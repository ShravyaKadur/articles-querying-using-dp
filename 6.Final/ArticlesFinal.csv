"SYDNEY: Australia look set to field two specialist spinners at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) for the first time in a decade when they host West Indies in a dead rubber New Years test starting this weekend.An inexperienced and demoralised West Indies touring party succumbed by an innings and 212 runs in Hobart and 177 runs in Melbourne to hand their hosts an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.That position, and the likelihood of a turning wicket at the SCG, have encouraged Australia to test out the twin spin option of Nathan Lyon and Stephen OKeefe ahead of their tour of Sri Lanka later this year.That the hosts can afford to put out an experimental side in one of the more venerable fixtures in the Australian sporting calendar is not to say there will be nothing at stake when the match gets underway on Sunday (1030 GMT).For West Indies there is pride and a chance to show more of the fighting spirit that stalled Australias victory match in the Boxing Day test in Melbourne last weekend.A 3-0 sweep, meanwhile, would send Australia above India to second in the test rankings and they would return to the summit if England can maintain a winning start and beat South Africa in their ongoing four-match series.Off-spinner Lyon is one of the first names on the Australian team sheet these days and he looks like being joined by left-arm finger spinner OKeefe in the Australian line-up.That was made all the more likely when seamer Peter Siddle failed to train on Friday because of an ankle injury, leaving his place in the team in jeopardy.OKeefes inclusion for his second test -- his first on home soil -- would make it the first time Australia have played twin spinners at the SCG since Shane Warne and Stuart MacGill took on South Africa at the ground in 2006.Josh Hazlewood is likely to back up for a sixth straight test alongside James Pattinson in the pace attack with all-rounder Mitchell Marsh offering support with his quickening medium pace deliveries after taking 4-61 in Melbourne.While Darren Bravo, Denesh Ramdin and skipper Jason Holder showed some resistance with the bat in Melbourne, the paucity of the West Indies bowling is starkly illustrated by the fact that they have taken just 10 wickets over the first two tests.Given how little pressure their pace attack have managed to exert on Australia so far in the series, West Indies might consider their own twin spin attack by bringing in leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo alongside left-arm orthodox Jomel Warrican.",01-01-2016,Australia set to test twin spin attack against Windi,cricket,SYDNEY,Shane;Bishoo;Mitchell Marsh;Denesh Ramdin;Peter Siddle;Warne;Devendra Bishoo;Darren;James Pattinson;Mitchell;Josh;Jason;Denesh;James;Holder;Pattinson;MacGill;Darren Bravo;Josh Hazlewood;Jason Holder;Shane Warne;Stuart;Stuart MacGill;Devendra;Siddle;Marsh;Peter;Hazlewood;Ramdin;Bravo;Stephen,Windi,SCG;West Indies;Nathan Lyon
"SYDNEY: After picking up pretty much every individual honour on offer in a spectacular 2015, Australia captain Steve Smith has a more collective goal in his sights this year -- restoring his country to the top of the test rankings.Smith finished his annus mirabilis as the worlds top ranked test batsman and won the ICC Cricketer and Test Cricketer of the Year awards as well as the Allan Border Medal as Australias best player.The 26-year-old scored a remarkable 2,369 runs across all three formats, rattling up 1,474 in tests alone at an average of 73.70 with six centuries.He was Australias highest run scorer as they secured a fifth 50-over World Cup triumph and he led the test side to series victories over India, New Zealand and West Indies.Even in the Ashes defeat to England, the one major blot on Australias copy book for the year, he scored his maiden double century to claim the Man of the Match award at Lords.Even before he was captain, though, Smith was always clear that team success came first.With Australia already 2-0 up in the three-match series, this weeks third test against West Indies might be a dead rubber but victory would send them above India into second place in the test rankings behind South Africa.""Its a huge motivation, thats what we want to be, number one in all formats and were working extremely hard to get there,"" Smith told reporters on the eve of the match at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) on Saturday.""It would be nice to win this week and wrap this series up 3-0. Its been a good summer for us so far, so wed like to finish on a high.""Defeat for South Africa in their ongoing series against England would then send Australia back to the summit but even if the English fail to build on their winning start, Februarys two-test tour of New Zealand offers Smiths side another chance.Australia beat the Black Caps 2-0 on home soil in November but the series was closer than the scoreline would suggest and Smiths side, like many of the top test teams, have struggled to win series overseas in recent years.""Playing away from home is a challenge for all teams around the world at the moment, I think thats one of the big things were going to be judged on,"" Smith added.""Its going to be a big challenge in New Zealand, but Im confident if we can continue playing the way we are, hopefully we can have a lot of success over there.""Smiths own form hit a minor blip when he was dismissed for 10 in Australias only innings in the first test against West Indies but the runs were flowing again in Melbourne last week after knocks of 134 and 70 without being dismissed.""I felt pretty good last week, I guess it was good just to spend a little bit of time in the middle again,"" Smith said.""All of my movement and my swing and everything was back in synch.I went back and looked at some footage before the Melbourne test and felt my bat face was a little bit closed.""Last week I got my bat face back where I wanted it to be and everything felt really good, so hopefully I can score a few more this week.",01-02-2016,Australia skipper Smith plots return to test summi,cricket,SYDNEY,Steve;Smith;Steve Smith,Smith;Steve Smith,Smiths;SCG
"WELLINGTON: New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum on Sunday said tainted bowler Mohammad Amir should be given the benefit of the doubt and allowed to play for Pakistan in limited-overs matches in New Zealand this month.Amir has been named in the Pakistan squad which will play three Twenty20 and as many one-day games against New Zealand over the next three weeks but his participation depends on New Zealand immigration officials allowing him a visa.The fast bowler was only 18 when he handed a five-year ban from cricket in 2011 for his involvement in spot fixing.He also served three months of a six month prison term.His ban, imposed by the International Cricket Council (ICC), has now ended and McCullum said today he should be allowed to resume his career.He was a very young man at the time and he's gone through a sound rehabilitation program, McCullum said.If he gets out on the field against us, then you play against the man you're playing against, not a man who may have made some mistakes as a youngster, added the explosive batsman.New Zealand Cricket chief executive David White also supported Amir's inclusion in the Pakistan squad but stressed that was a personal view and not that of his organisation.He was a very, very young man, a boy really (when he was suspended), White said.He showed remorse at the time, admitted to it. He's gone through all the rehabilitation and education as prescribed by the ICC.I'm personally comfortable with him coming to New Zealand and playing, added White.New Zealand's immigration department issued a statement before Christmas saying it had not yet received a visa application for Amir and would consider one when it is received.A decision is likely next week.",01-03-2016,McCullum says Amir should get benefit of doub,cricket,WELLINGTON,David White;Mohammad Amir;Amir;Brendon;Mohammad;Brendon McCullum;White;David;McCullum,Amir;McCullum;Mohammad Amir;Brendon McCullum,New Zealand;International Cricket Council;ICC
"CAPE TOWN: Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow tore apart the South African bowling attack as they enjoyed a run feast at Newlands on a record-breaking second day of the second Test which led to England declaring their first innings on 629 for six.South Africa were 24 for one wicket in reply at tea with a 605-run deficit.Stokes amassed 258 runs and Bairstow an unbeaten 150 as they bludgeoned a limp-looking home attack from the opening ball on Sunday, setting a new sixth-wicket Test record of 399 runs.Stokes notched up the quickest 250 (off 196 balls) in Test history after scoring the second fastest double century (163 balls) in a knock that lasted 198 deliveries, which included 30 fours and a England record 11 sixes.Bairstow notched an emotional first test century, with England declaring once he got to 150 off 191 balls with 18 fours and two sixes.The pair took the overnight score from 317 for five in a remarkable one and half sessions of devastating batting before putting the dispirited-looking home side into bat.Stokes double century took 10 balls more than New Zealands Nathan Astle, who holds the record for the fastest double century in 153 balls. Englands previous fastest was by Ian Botham who took 220 balls.In reaching 250 off 196 balls, Stokes beat Virender Sehwags record and also set the highest score by a batsman at number six, beating a 39-year-old mark held by Australian Doug Walters.England, already 1-0 up in the four-Test series after winning the first test in Durban by 241 runs, went from 300 to 400 in 15 overs and 400 to 500 runs in just 11 overs playing as if it was a Twenty20 match.They set the tone from the start of the second day with 45 runs in the first four overs as Stokes advanced from 74 not out overnight to his century.Bairstow started the day on 39.Stokes eventually went out in something of an anti-climax as he skied a shot to AB de Villiers, who dropped a simple-looking catch only to sweep up the ball and hit the stumps to run out the batsman as he ambled back to the crease.South Africas horror day did not end after the declaration with Stiaan van Zyl run out for four in the third over of their first innings, setting off for a quick run but being sent back by opening partner Dean Elgar.Elgar (8) and captain Hashim Amla (10) were not out at tea with Elgar surviving a leg before wicket decision after a review showed he got the slightest of edges to the ball.

"CAPE TOWN: Ben Stokes scored the second fastest double century in Tests and led a run feast on the second day of the second Test against South Africa by battering the home attack to take England to 513 for five wickets at lunch.Stokes (204 not out) and Jonny Bairstow, who was unbeaten on 95, bludgeoned a limp-looking home attack from the opening ball on Sunday, setting a new sixth-wicket record stand for England.The pair took the overnight score from 317 for five in a remarkable session that produced 196 runs in two hours of devastating batting.Stokes double century came off 163 balls with 26 fours and seven sixes.New Zealands Nathan Astle holds the record for the fastest double century in 153 balls while Englands previous fastest was by Ian Botham who took 220 balls.Stokes now holds the record score for an England number six, beating Graham Hicks 187 against India in 1993, and became the first English centurion at Newlands for 50 years.He produced an array of astonishing boundaries, bringing up his 200 by pulling Morne Morkel for a four and leaving the home side looking dispirited in the field on another hot day in Cape Town.England, already 1-0 up in the four-Test series after winning the first Test in Durban by 241 runs, went from 300 to 400 in 15 overs and 400 to 500 runs in just 11 overs.The tourists began Sundays play like they were playing a Twenty20 match with 45 runs in the first four overs as Stokes advanced from 74 not out overnight to his century and did not let up after that.Bairstow brought up his 50 soon after -- his fourth in five innings against South Africa -- as the pair picked up the pace with 102 runs in the first hours play.The South African bowling attack, without injured Dale Steyn and Vernon Philander, had their figures hammered with debutant Chris Morris going to lunch having conceded 141 runs for his single wicket.Kagiso Rabada was 3-123 and spinner Dane Piedt 0-112.

"SYDNEY: Australias spinners Nathan Lyon and Stephen OKeefe took key wickets between rain showers to peg West Indies back to 207 for six at the end of a weather-disrupted opening day of the dead rubber third Test on Sunday.More than two hours and 45 minutes of play were lost to rain in a stop-start day at the Sydney Cricket Ground, where the tourists fell away in the early evening gloom after winning the toss and making a solid start.Denesh Ramdin, unbeaten on 23, and Carlos Brathwaite (35 not out) will resume on day two if the forecast heavy rain stays away.The hosts had rolled the dice on the twin spin attack at the SCG for the first time in a decade and got their reward when Lyon and OKeefe got plenty of turn off a straw-coloured wicket.Off-spinner Lyon (2-68) produced a stunning delivery that pitched wide and turned in to take the bail off Jermaine Blackwoods off stump for 10 and returned after the second rain break to remove dangerman Kraigg Brathwaite for 85.Left-arm orthodox spinner OKeefe (1-42) then pitched in to have West Indies captain Jason Holder caught superbly at short leg by Joe Burns and claim his first test wicket on Australian soil.Trailing 2-0 in the three-match series after thumping defeats in Hobart and Melbourne, West Indies had started the day by building on their improved batting performance in the second Test.After the early loss of opener Shai Hope (nine), Kraigg Brathwaite and Darren Bravo (33) looked in fine nick as they ushered the tourists to lunch at 92 for one.Australias bowlers emerged from the break re-energised, however, and James Pattinson got the breakthrough when Bravos miscued pull sent the ball flying to Usman Khawaja running in from the deep.That broke a 91-run partnership and brought Marlon Samuels to the crease looking to break his run of eight test innings without getting to the 20-run mark.He failed in farcical fashion looking for a quick single that always looked like a gamble, left stranded when Kraigg Brathwaite scuttled back to his crease as Peter Nevill broke the stumps.After a long glare at his partner, Samuels headed back to the pavilion with four runs to his name and the rest of the players and umpires followed in his wake as heavy rain came down on the ground.Kraigg Brathwaite had brought up his eighth test half-century just before lunch by clipping all-rounder Mitchell Marsh past long leg for two runs off the 78th ball he faced. He fell 15 runs shy off his fifth test century when Lyon got a little bit of extra bounce to a delivery which caught the openers glove and was snaffled up by Steve Smith at slip.

"CAPE TOWN: Captain Hashim Amla scored an unbeaten century on the third day of the second Test against England and AB de Villiers made 88 as South Africa reached tea on 290 for three on Monday.Amla scored his first hundred for more than a year and De Villiers reached 8,000 Test runs before he pulled a short ball from Steven Finn to James Anderson at mid-wicket just before the interval.South Africa trailed the touring side by 339 runs, 140 short of avoiding the follow-on, with Amla on 132 not out and Faf du Plessis on 15.Amla and De Villiers resumed on 141 for two and extended their partnership to 183, giving South Africa a foothold in the game after England declared on a massive total of 629 for six on a second day of record-breaking batting.The experienced pair played with much circumspection but did offer chances.<br/> Amla was twice dropped -- by Joe Root on 76 and Nick Compton on 120 -- and De Villiers survived an lbw appeal after asking for a review, which showed he got a slight nick to a Ben Stokes delivery.De Villiers became the third South African batsman to pass 8,000 runs while Amla, who last made a significant contribution with 208 runs against the West Indies in December 2014, moved past 7,000 runs.The 31-year-old De Villiers joined Jacques Kallis (13,206) and Graeme Smith (9,253) on the list of South Africans with more than 8,000 Test runs.England, 1-0 up in the series, bowled good lines and with spells of aggression on a pitch that offered little assistance and in hot temperatures of over 30 degrees celsius.The third day, however, provided none of the fireworks of Sunday when Stokes and Jonny Bairstow smashed the ball to all corners of the picturesque ground.<br/> (Reuters)",01-04-2016,Amla makes century De Villiers falls for 88,cricket,CAPE TOWN,Jonny Bairstow;de;Jacques;du;AB de Villiers;AB;De;Joe;Bairstow;Root;Compton;Kallis;Nick;Smith;Jacques Kallis;Joe Root;Steven;Stokes;Hashim;Finn;James Anderson;Ben Stokes delivery.De Villiers;De Villiers;Graeme Smith;Plessis;Faf du Plessis;Nick Compton;delivery.De;Graeme;Amla;Hashim Amla;James;Faf;Ben;Anderson;Steven Finn;Villiers;Jonny,De Villiers;Amla;Hashim Amla,De Villiers;Reuters
"SYDNEY: Carlos Brathwaite shone briefly for West Indies but the rain was the only real winner on Monday as wet weather washed away all but 11.2 overs of play on the second day of the third Test against Australia.West Indies were 248 for seven in their first innings when the rain interrupted play for the third and final time half an hour after lunch in the wake of Brathwaites dismissal for 69.Play was officially abandoned at 4:35 p.m.(0535 GMT) as the rain continued to cascade down on Sydney Cricket Ground with the 14,266 optimistic souls who came through the gates despite the gloomy forecast offered a full refund.That meant that the flurry of boundaries with which Brathwaite lit up the few overs of action was ultimately a free show and the 27-year-old was warmly applauded for it by an appreciative crowd.Resuming on 35 with his team on 207 for six, the tall, muscular Bajan showed why he has been one of the few bright spots for West Indies on what has otherwise been a miserable tour.Playing his second Test after scoring 59 on debut in Melbourne last week, Brathwaite smashed four sixes and seven fours in his 71-ball innings.One of the two sixes he hit in one over off Australia paceman James Pattinson was a spectacular heave over the covers and deep into the crowd.A fuming Pattinson had his revenge, however, when he found his range and took out Brathwaites off stump with what the batsman described as a ""good nut"".""I was upset that once again I got a start and couldnt carry on. One of the main mantras in cricket is that when things are going good you maximize,"" Brathwaite said.""Then reaching halfway off and hearing the applause -- I even saw some people standing -- I just took a step back and said you know what, just enjoy the feeling. I raised my bat and looked around and it was a very, very good feeling.""Denesh Ramdin will resume on 30 not out for West Indies alongside Kemar Roach, who has yet to score, on day three.Only three balls were bowled in the first two hours of scheduled play and another 21 before lunch after the action resumed briefly at noon.Nearly three hours of play were lost to rain on day one of the match, a dead rubber after Australia racked up convincing victories in the first two Tests.

"CAPE TOWN: Jonny Bairstow pumped his chest to the sky and wiped away a tear as he completed an emotional maiden test hundred for England against South Africa on Sunday, amid a record-breaking stand with Ben Stokes.The red-haired England wicketkeeper last year lost his grandfather, with whom he shared a close relationship, while his dad David, a former England cricketer, killed himself in 1998.Obviously after everything that has gone on in the last year or so its fantastic to get over the line for me and my family, he told reporters after finishing on 150 not out with his mother and sister watching on from the stands.

"CAPE TOWN: England grabbed three wickets in 23 balls to inject life back into the second Test but any hopes they had of skittling South Africa out were ended by Temba Bavuma on Tuesday.The young batsman scored an unbeaten 52 to take South Africa to 525 for six at tea on the fourth day, trailing England by 104 runs with four session left in the match.Chris Morris, making his debut, was unbeaten on 24 in an unbroken 76-run partnership.South Africa batted slowly in the morning as they chipped away at Englands massive first-innings score of 629 for six declared.Hashim Amla reached his double century before the new ball after lunch brought a breakthrough when Stuart Broad bowled the hosts captain for 201.Faf du Plessis fell three balls later after making 86 off 216 balls, edging a low catch to Ben Stokes at third slip off the bowling of James Anderson.Quinton de Kock, back in the side after missing the last four Tests, fell for a trap set for him as he pulled a ball from Broad straight to Anderson at short square leg.Bavuma played an array of attacking strokes to race to his fifty off 52 balls with Morris playing a good supporting role.Amla effectively played his side back into the Test series with his patient innings which took almost 12 hours and included 27 fours.Dropped twice on Monday, an otherwise unflappable Amla betrayed nerves on 197, skying a shot and watching anxiously as Joe Root misjudged the ball and failed to get close to it.South Africa were 353 for three overnight and had made it clear they wanted to keep England in the field for much of the day again in baking-hot temperatures, well over 30 degrees Celsius.England lead the four-match series 1-0.

"CAPE TOWN: Captain Hashim Amla remained unbeaten after his third Test double century as South Africa moved closer to forcing a draw against England in the second Test at Newlands on Tuesday.Amla was 200 not out at lunch with Faf du Plessis (81) at the other end, guiding the hosts to 428 for three.The blooming 160-run partnership between them helped South Africa cut their deficit to 201 after Englands swashbuckling first innings total of 629-6 declared.Dropped twice on Monday, an otherwise unflappable Amla betrayed nerves on 197, skying a shot and watching anxiously as Joe Root misjudged the ball and failed to get close to it.Amla scrambled for two runs to go to 199 and brought up his double century off 461 balls in an innings that offers both him and South Africa much inspiration after 12 months of dismal Test cricket.South Africa had kept England in the field through the entire third day on Monday, losing just one wicket and looked determined to inflict more energy-sapping misery on the visitors on the fourth day.They started overnight on 353-3 and added 75 runs from 30 overs in the first session of the fourth day.England produced some lively overs early on Tuesday but then turned to off spin as they moved closer to taking the third new ball, which is available immediately after lunch.England did have a chance to catch du Plessis when he was on 61 but the edge flashed past James Anderson at first slip off the bowling of Moeen Ali.It was similar to the catch that Anderson had grassed on Monday when Amla got a thick edge to a delivery from Root.England are 1-0 ahead in the four-Test series.

"MUMBAI: Maharashtra schoolboy Pranav Dhanawade rewrote the record books on Tuesday, hammering an epic 1009 not out in an inter-school cricket tournament to register the highest individual score in an innings in any form of the game.The 15-year-old smashed 129 fours and clobbered 59 sixes in his staggering 323-ball knock played over two days before his team, KC Gandhi School, declared their innings on a staggering 1465 for two.An admirer of India's limited overs captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Dhanawade's monumental knock drew praise from batting great Sachin Tendulkar.""Congrats #PranavDhanawade on being the first ever to score 1000 runs in an innings.

"Matt Henry took the second five-wicket haul of his career to bowl New Zealand to a 36-run victory over Sri Lanka in the fifth one-day international and seal a 3-1 series victory at Bay Oval in Mt. Maunganui on Tuesday.Henry, who took four-wicket hauls in two other appearances in the series, finished with 5-40 as Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews had threatened to steal victory for his side.Mathews combined with his strong middle order to guide the run chase for 295 to snatch a draw in the series but when he was the eighth wicket to fall for 95, it effectively ended Sri Lankas chances and they were bowled out for 258 in 47.1 overs.Martin Guptill top-scored for New Zealand with 102 to give the hosts a competitive, though not daunting, total of 294 for five.New Zealand had ripped the top off Sri Lankas lineup to reduce them to 33 for three in the 10th over but Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal (50) produced a 93-run fourth-wicket partnership that was broken just as Chandimal reached his 15th half century.Mathews and Milinda Siriwardana (39) then put on 62 runs in 6.4 overs to take them to within 72 runs with nine overs remaining.The match then turned in the next three overs when Siriwardana and Chamara Kapugedara (10) were both dismissed, sending the required run rate over 10 and the chase effectively ended when Mathews became Henrys fourth victim in the 46th over.While Guptill had top-scored in New Zealands innings, it was Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor, who both scored 61, played the anchor roles to allow the opener to score his 10th one-day international century.Guptill, the highest run scorer in one-dayers last year, hit nine boundaries and three sixes.He finished with 331 runs in the five-match series at an average of 82.75.Sri Lankas bowlers did an excellent job at the end of New Zealands innings by clamping down on their scoring rate that had threatened to push the score well past 300.The two sides now play two Twenty20 internationals, with the first at the same venue on Thursday.",01-05-2016,Henry takes five as NZ complete series win over SL,cricket,,Mathews;Chandimal;Angelo;Kane Williamson;Kane;Milinda Siriwardana;Matt;Angelo Mathews;Siriwardana;Williamson;Ross;Chamara Kapugedara;Milinda;Henry;Taylor;Ross Taylor;Matt Henry;Guptill;Dinesh Chandimal;Dinesh;Kapugedara;Chamara,Henry;Matt Henry,

"CAPE TOWN: Poor weather brought a limp end to a compelling second Test as England survived a final day onslaught from South Africa to draw the match and keep up their 1-0 lead in the series.England were 159 for six in their second innings, with Jonny Bairstow (30) and Moeen Ali (10) unbeaten, before drizzle and bad light halted play soon after tea on Wednesday.South Africas quick bowlers made inroads in the morning to offer the likelihood of a remarkable come-from-behind victory after England had dominated the opening two days to amass 629 for six declared in their first innings.South Africa clawed back over the next two days, keeping England in the field on hot, energy-sapping days as they slowly regained a foothold and eventually declared just two runs short of the visitors total.A four-wicket burst before lunch on Wednesday suddenly offered the tantalising possibility of a result and two more in the second session brought South Africa even closer to scuttling out England before chasing down a modest target.But dogged resistance from Bairstow and Ali, in an unbroken 43-run partnership, and the gloomy weather dashed South Africas hopes of pulling off a remarkable victory.England started the day on 16-0 in their second innings, with a lead of 18 runs, but captain Alastair Cook was strangled down the leg side and caught by wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock off Kagiso Rabadas bowling with just the eighth ball of the morning.He went for eight with England having added a single to their overnight total.Alex Hales (5) was then snagged by a brilliant diving one-handed catch from Chris Morris at slip to give Morne Morkel a deserved wicket after some fiery bowling.Joe Root was caught in the slips by AB de Villiers off Morkel on 17 but television replays showed the bowler had stepped over the line.But Englands top-ranked batsman failed to capitalise on the reprieve and scored 12 more runs before being bowled by Morris to leave England on 55-3.Nick Compton (15) fell 10 minutes before lunch after playing straight to Faf du Plessis at short mid-wicket as he became the first of three victims for Dane Piedt.After the interval, the off spinner dismissed Ben Stokes, caught at deep square leg for 26, and James Taylor, who got a nasty bounce up onto his gloves and was caught by Temba Bavuma at short leg for 27.The third Test will be at the Wanderers in Johannesburg from Jan.14-18.

"CAPE TOWN: Off-spinner Dane Piedt raised hopes of an unlikely South African victory as he grabbed three wickets on Wednesday to leave England on 155 for six at tea on the final day of the high-scoring second Test.Just when it seemed that the match was heading for a draw, Piedt raised prospects of an unexpected victory after claiming the wickets of Nick Compton, first innings double centurion Ben Stokes and James Taylor which left England with a 157-run lead going into the final session.Jonny Bairstow (26 not out) and Moeen Ali (10 not out) frustrated South Africas efforts to skittle England out cheaply in their second innings and set themselves a reachable target before close of play on Wednesday.Cloud cover over Newlands offered bowlers the swing that had been missing over the previous four, searingly-hot days and helped South Africa to claim quick wickets to spice up the game.Englands batsmen looked short on confidence as a little moisture in the air and an absence of wind presented bowlers with a window of opportunity.England started the day on 16-0 in their second innings, having an 18-run lead over South Africa after both posted high-scoring totals in the first innings.Cook (8) was strangled down the leg side and caught by wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock off Kagiso Rabadas bowling on the eighth ball of the morning with England having added a single to their overnight total.Alex Hales (5) was snagged by a brilliant diving one-handed catch from Chris Morris at slip to give Morne Morkel a deserved wicket after some fiery bowling.Joe Root was caught in the slips by AB de Villiers off Morkel on 17 but television replays showed the bowler had stepped over the line.But Englands top-ranked batsman failed to capitalise on the reprieve and scored 12 more runs before being bowled by Morris to leave England on 55-3.Compton fell 10 minutes before lunch as he played straight to Faf du Plessis at short mid-wicket and was out after a tentative 15.After lunch, Piedt dismissed Stokes, caught at deep square leg for 26, and Taylor, who got a nasty bounce up onto his gloves and was caught by Temba Bavuma at short leg for 27.England had looked set to win a second successive Test when they went on a run-scoring riot on Sunday to shatter several records in amassing 629 for six declared.But South Africa batted themselves back into the game over three days eventually declaring on 627-7 some 30 minutes before the end of Tuesdays play and then sparking hopes of victory with an attacking bowling display on Wednesday.

I didnt want to play if I wasnt somewhat prepared, so I worked really hard in the off season to try and catch up a bit.""Returning at Shenzhen was a relief for the Canadian, whose run to the 2014 Wimbledon final and the Australian and French semi-finals in the same year saw her touted as a future world number one.""To step on the court and play a full match with no pain, play three matches three days in a row, was a success for me even though I lost the last match,"" said Bouchard, now ranked 49th in the world after peaking at five in Oct. 2014.Bouchard will face American Bethanie Mattek-Sands in the first round in Hobart.

"BRISBANE: An inspired Milos Raonic toppled Roger Federer 6-4 6-4 to win the Brisbane International on Sunday and avenge his defeat to the Swiss master in last years final.Raonic unleashed his usual serving blitz but it was the rangy Canadians groundstrokes that impressed the most as he outwitted the Swiss with a masterful display of clean hitting from the baseline.Federer, irrepressible in his semi-final win over Dominic Thiem, was off-colour from the start at Pat Rafter Arena and his 25-year-old opponent feasted repeatedly on his wayward backhand.Beaten in three tight sets last year, Raonic won at a canter in the rematch to clinch his eighth tour title and complete the perfect buildup to his bid for a maiden grand slam at the Australian Open starting later this month.Closing out the match with a booming first serve that Federer could only parry long, Raonic roared in triumph, having beaten the 17-times grand slam champion for only the second time in 11 encounters.He accepted the winners trophy from 77-year-old Australian great Rod Laver, the only player to complete the calendar grand slam twice.Long tipped to rock the tennis establishment, Raonic showed a bullet-proof poise in response to his opponents frustration and broke Federers serve in the ninth game of the opening set.Federer blasted a forehand long to concede the set then blew a gilt-edged chance to break Raonic early in the second by spraying a backhand long.Missing a regulation forehand winner down the line, Federer gave up a break-point and Raonic captured the decisive break in the eighth game.Federer battled hard to put the set back on level terms, but Raonics thunderbolt serve proved to be impenetrable.(Reuters)",01-10-2016,Raonic takes revenge on Federer to win Brisbane ti,tennis,BRISBANE,Roger;Pat Rafter Arena;Rod Laver;Federer;Dominic;Pat;Rod;Thiem;Arena;Roger Federer;Raonic;Laver;Dominic Thiem;Milos;Milos Raonic;Rafter;Raonics,Raonic;Federer;Milos Raonic;Roger Federer,Reuters;Brisbane International
"AUCKLAND: Colin Munro blasted New Zealands fastest Twenty20 half century to surpass a mark set by Martin Guptill earlier in the innings as the hosts swept their two-match series against Sri Lanka with a nine-wicket win in Auckland on Sunday.Guptill first rewrote the record books when he took just 19 deliveries to bring up his eighth half century in the shortest form of the game before he was eventually dismissed for 63 after smashing six boundaries and five sixes.His mark was then eclipsed by Munro some 20 minutes later when the left hander hit his seventh six to take New Zealand to 147 for one, the hosts chasing down Sri Lankas 142-8 total at Eden Park in just 10 overs.Munros half century came off 14 balls, the second fastest in international cricket behind Indias Yuvraj Singh (12 balls).He hit one four along with his seven maximums to finish unbeaten on exactly 50.The 2-0 series defeat also ensured Sri Lanka, the 2014 World Twenty20 champions, were replaced by West Indies at the top of the International Cricket Council (ICC) T20 rankings.Sri Lankas innings had been held together by Test and one-day captain Angelo Mathews 81 not out, his highest score in the format, while opener Tillakaratne Dilshan scored a streaky 28.No other batsmen got into double figures.As in most of the limited overs matches on the tour, Sri Lankas top order failed to get their innings going, slumping to 39-3 in the seventh over.Their normally reliable, and deep, middle order also failed to capitalise on Eden Parks small boundaries as New Zealands bowlers varied their pace, line, length and flight, with part-time medium pacer Grant Elliott taking 4-22.The sixth Twenty20 World Cup takes place in India from March 8 to April 3.

"SYDNEY: World number two Simona Halep overcame a nagging Achilles problem to beat Caroline Garcia of France at the Sydney International on Tuesday ahead of next weeks Australian Open.The Romanian withdrew from the Brisbane International last week because of the injury, which also affected her 2015 campaign, and she called the trainer during her second-round match.Halep, who was given a first-round bye, said the pain was coming and going but she produced some of her best tennis in the deciding set on the way to a 6-4 2-6 6-1 victory that set up a quarter-final against Czech fifth seed Karolina Pliskova.""When you have pain you always get scared because you dont know what is going to happen,"" she said after her win. ""I felt actually yesterday during the practice same thing. Five minutes pain, five minutes without pain.""I dont know exactly what this is. MRI showed that I have just an inflammation and I can keep playing, so I will do my best and I will try to be there, to stay focused.""The 24-year-old is one of four leading women players heading to the Australian Open, which begins in Melbourne on Monday, under an injury cloud.World number one Serena Williams (knee), fifth-ranked Maria Sharapova (arm) and number three Garbine Muguruza (foot) all withdrew from matches in the last week.Halep said before the clash with the 34th-ranked Garcia she was fit but she looked anything but during her medical time out after the Frenchwoman stepped up the aggression to take the second set.Halep, though, shrugged off the complaint to storm through the third set, reeling off five straight games and recording her first win of the year when Garcia netted a straightforward mid-court forehand.""I needed matches to see if I can stay during the match until the end with my achilles,"" she said.""I did well today.

"PERTH: Captain Steve Smith and George Bailey struck fluent centuries as Australia chased down a steep 310-run target to win the first one-day international against India by five wickets in Perth on Tuesday.Smith fell for his highest ODI score of 149 with Australia two runs short of victory and the right-hander left the ground shaking his head before watching his team seal victory with four balls to spare.Opener Rohit Sharma smashed an unbeaten 171 to lift India to 309 for three after the touring side won the toss and chose to bat first in sublime batting conditions at the WACA ground.India lost Shikhar Dhawan (nine) early but Rohit, the only cricketer with two double centuries in this format, and test captain Virat Kohli (91) laid the platform for a late flourish with a 207-run stand for the second wicket.India left-arm paceman Barinder Sran (3-56) gave his side a dream start on his debut by dismissing hard-hitting openers Aaron Finch (eight) and David Warner (five) in successive overs to reduce Australia to 21 for two.But Bailey (112) scored his third ODI hundred and added 242 for the third wicket with his skipper to take the match away from India.Bailey was lucky to survive an appeal for caught behind on the first ball he faced with television replays confirming Brans delivery brushing his glove on the way through to wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni.India also missed several opportunities to run the right-hander out when their throws failed to hit the stumps.Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin sent back Bailey and Glenn Maxwell (six) in successive overs to give India hope but it was too little, too late.The 28-year-old Rohit, whose 264 against Sri Lanka in 2014 remains the highest individual score in the 50-over format, hit 13 fours and seven sixes.Rohits 163-ball knock was the highest score by a visiting batsman against Australia, overtaking West Indies great Viv Richardss unbeaten 153 in 1979 in Melbourne.Kohli fell in unselfish manner trying to score quickly for his team and was out caught close to the boundary rope by Aaron Finch off paceman James Faulkner, who finished with figures of 2-60 in his 10 overs.",01-12-2016,Smith Bailey tons power Australia to five wicket wi,cricket,PERTH,Barinder Sran;Viv;Glenn Maxwell;Dhoni.India;Maxwell;Sran;Aaron;Warner;George;Aaron Finch;Rohit Sharma;Ravichandran;Viv Richardss;Steve Smith;Singh;Finch;Glenn;Faulkner;Shikhar Dhawan;David Warner;Bailey;Virat;Rohit;Richardss;James;Smith;Mahendra;Mahendra Singh Dhoni.India;Ravichandran Ashwin;George Bailey;Virat Kohli;Sharma;Steve;Barinder;Shikhar;Kohli;Ashwin;Dhawan;David;James Faulkner,Smith Bailey,India.Bailey
"ZURICH: Lionel Messi reclaimed the FIFA Ballon d'Or award for the world player of the year on Monday from his great rival Cristiano Ronaldo who had walked off with the award for the previous two years.The Barcelona and Argentina forward took 41.33 percent of the votes followed by the Portuguese and Real Madrid forward (27.76 percent), with Brazil and Barcelona forward Neymar third (7.86 per cent).""It is a very special moment for me to be back here on this stage, winning again another Ballon dOr after being there in the audience watching Cristiano win,"" said Messi as he accepted the award at the end of a drawn-out 90-minute ceremony.""Its incredible this is my fifth.""Barcelona's Luis Enrique was voted coach of the year while United States World Cup winner Carli Lloyd, who scored a hat-trick in the final against Japan, was named women's player of the year.Initially started as the FIFA World Player of the Year award in 1991, it became known as the Ballon d'Or after merging with France Football's European footballer of the year award in 2010.The award, shared exclusively between Messi and Real Madrid's Ronaldo since Brazilian Kaka won in 2007, has been heavily promoted by FIFA and was broadcast to 190 countries with 1,100 guests including players and coaches attending the ceremony.But it is not everyone's cup of tea and some critics, such as Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, say it is not appropriate in a team sport.""Im a big enemy of the Ballon dOr. Who will win it? You know as well as I do that its certainly Messi who will win it. I think so. Overall Im not a big fan of that,"" the Frenchman said earlier on Monday.The breakdown presented by FIFA also revealed tactical voting among the 165 national team coaches, 162 national team captains and 171 media representatives who cast votes.Messi, eligible to vote as Argentina captain, named Barcelona team mates Luis Suarez, Neymar and Andres Iniesta as his top three.Portugal captain Ronaldo choose three Real Madrid team mates -- Karim Benzema, James Rodriguez and Gareth Bale.Belgium captain Vincent Kompany opted for his compatriots Eden Hazard and Kevin de Bruyne as his top two.More surprisingly, Spain captain Iker Casillas -- the former Real Madrid goalkeeper who now plays for Portuguese club Porto -- was among those who did not vote.Despite a red carpet and plenty of glitz, the event had a low-key air of predictability about it and was held against the backdrop of FIFA going through the worst corruption crisis since it was founded in 1904.The sport is facing criminal investigations in both Switzerland and the United States, where some leading FIFA officials are among 41 individuals and sports entities who have been indicted on corruption charges.Outgoing FIFA president Sepp Blatter, normally a central figure in the ceremony, was not involved after being banned for eight years by the Ethics Committee in December and there was no President's Award, usually given out by Blatter for outstanding services to the game.Past recipients have included Pele, former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, the Haiti national team, Queen Rania of Jordan and South African anti-apartheid activist and veteran cleric, Archbishop Desmond Tutu.Acting president Issa Hayatou played a low-key role, reading a brief speech before the start and appearing on stage when the awards for best player and women's player were presented.Ronaldo said the players did not want to discuss FIFA's problems.""We avoid answering this kind of question,"" he told a press conference before the ceremony.""We are professional football players, we compete every week, every day, we train and we just focus on that. These things happen not just in football but in life, and the best thing would be no corruption anywhere.""In terms of individual achievement, Ronaldo had slightly the better in the last year, scoring 54 goals in 52 games for Real Madrid, compared to Messi's 48 in 53.",01-12-2016,Lionel Messi wins Ballon dOr for fifth ti,football,ZURICH,de;Ferguson;Sepp Blatter;Iniesta;Benzema;Ballon;Cristiano;Lionel Messi;Andres;Alex;Wenger;Karim;Bale.Belgium;Gareth Bale.Belgium;Kevin;Luis;Issa;Enrique;Rodriguez;Messi;Arsene;Kevin de Bruyne;Andres Iniesta;Desmond;Issa Hayatou;Ronaldo;Karim Benzema;Hayatou;Tutu.Acting;Vincent Kompany;Cristiano Ronaldo;Iker;Alex Ferguson;Arsene Wenger;Lionel;Blatter;Gareth;Sepp;Bruyne;Desmond Tutu.Acting;Vincent;Luis Suarez;James;Casillas;Rania;Suarez;Iker Casillas;Pele;Carli;Kaka;Luis Enrique;Kompany;Carli Lloyd;Lloyd;James Rodriguez;Neymar,Ballon;Lionel Messi,France Football;Real Madrid;Barcelona;FIFA World;FIFA Ballon;Porto;Arsenal;Manchester United;FIFA;Ethics Committee

"JOHANNESBURG: New South Africa captain AB de Villiers won the toss and elected to bat at the start of the third test against England at the Wanderers on Thursday as the hosts awaited the late arrival of a replacement wicketkeeper.De Villiers, who has taken over from Hashim Amla, said the decision was based on the batting form of his team from the second test in Newlands, where they fought valiantly to earn a draw after England had scored 626 runs in the first innings.""It wasnt an easy decision but we want to put some pressure on England.We turned things around as far as our confidence is concerned in Cape Town and we come into this game energised,"" De Villiers said in a pitchside interview.South Africa, who trail the four-match series 1-0, made two changes from the second test, one under bizarre last-minute circumstances.Wicketkeeper Dane Vilas was forced to make a desperate dash to the ground after being called up as a late replacement for the injured Quinton de Kock.Vilas was destined to arrive late for the first ball at 10:30 a. m. (0830 GMT) because Cricket South Africa could not book him on a flight earlier than 8 a.m. from Port Elizabeth, where he was due to play in a four-day provincial match.Flights from the coastal city to Johannesburg take two hours and the usual heavy traffic from the airport to the stadium looks set to add more drama to the dash.De Kock sustained a freak injury to his right knee on Wednesday.""Quinton slipped and sprained his right knee at home late yesterday afternoon,"" South Africa manager Mohammed Moosajee said on Thursday.South Africa have also handed a debut to fast bowler Hardus Viljoen at the expense of spinner Dane Piedt.England, who won the first test by 241 runs in Durban, were unchanged despite several of the side recovering from a stomach virus that swept through the squad in Cape Town.em><strong>Teams:</strong></emstrong>South Africa:</strongStiaan van Zyl, Dean Elgar, Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers (captain), Faf du Plessis, Temba Bavuma, Dane Vilas (wicketkeeper), Chris Morris, Kagiso Rabada, Morne Morkel, Hardus Viljoenstrong>England:</strongAlastair Cook (captain), Alex Hales, Nick Compton, Joe Root, James Taylor, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow (wicketkeeper), Moeen Ali, Stuart Broad, Steven Finn, James Anderson.",1/14/2016,South Africa opt to bat in 3rd test against England,cricket,JOHANNESBURG,Hardus;Jonny Bairstow;de;Kock.Vilas;Vilas;Viljoen;du;Stuart Broad;Chris;Morris;De;Alex;Joe;Bairstow;Compton;Root;James Taylor;Taylor;Nick;Chris Morris;Joe Root;Dean;Moeen Ali;Steven;Quinton;Temba Bavuma;Stokes;Dane;Broad;Kagiso;Rabada;Hashim;Moeen;Finn;Dean Elgar;James Anderson;Hales;De Villiers;Cook;Dane Piedt.England;Elgar;Dane Vilas;Plessis;Ben Stokes;Faf du Plessis;Nick Compton;Morkel;Moosajee;Morne;Kagiso Rabada;Bavuma;Amla;Hashim Amla;Hardus Viljoen;Piedt.England;James;Mohammed;Faf;Ben;Zyl;Anderson;Steven Finn;Villiers;Morne Morkel;Jonny;Temba;Stuart;Mohammed Moosajee;Alex Hales;Quinton de Kock.Vilas;Ali,,AB de Villiers
"JOHANNESBURG: Joe Root and Ben Stokes shared a rapid unbeaten partnership of 71 to put the brakes on a hostile South African attack and lift England to 162 for four at tea on the second day of the third Test on Friday.Replying to South Africas first-innings total of 313, Root scored the first half century of the match and was unbeaten on 60 with Stokes on 38 at the interval.Hardus Viljoen took the wicket of England captain Alastair Cook with his first ball in Test cricket and there were wickets for Kagiso Rabada and Morne Morkel as South Africa unleashed a barrage of pace to put England in trouble at 91 for four.But Root and Stokes, two of Englands most exciting young players, lifted the stranglehold as the touring side, 1-0 up in the series, plundered 135 runs in the afternoon session.Earlier, Alex Hales, who has been struggling with a stomach virus, went for one when he edged Rabada to AB de Villiers at second slip and Cooks poor form continued after edging Viljoens first ball down the leg side to be caught by wicketkeeper Dane Vilas for 18.Nick Compton was caught in the slips by Dean Elgar off Rabada for 26 just after he and Root had put together a 50-run partnership for the third wicket. James Taylor departed for seven, caught at short leg by Temba Bavuma off Morkel for seven.South Africa had resumed on 267 for seven overnight and England removed Chris Morris and Rabada for the addition of only 14 runs, both caught by wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow off Stuart Broad and James Anderson, who claimed his first wicket after toiling for 22 overs without success.But debutant Viljoen, who hit a boundary from the first ball he faced as a test batsman, and Morkel frustrated the bowlers by adding 32 runs in six overs for the last wicket. Bairstow dropped an easy catch off Anderson which denied him a chance to equal the world record of seven dismissals in an innings.Andersons follow-through after the delivery led him to encroach on the wicket and having been warned twice for running on the pitch, he was removed from the England attack by umpire Aleem Dar after an acrimonious exchange between the pair.He had bowled just two balls of his over and Stokes was brought on to complete it, finishing off the innings with his first ball when Morkel edged to Cook at first slip to give the all-rounder his 50th test wicket.South Africas total was the lowest for a Test innings in which all the batsmen reached double figures.

"BRISBANE: Indias Rohit Sharma burnished his reputation in limited-overs cricket with a second successive century but could not stop Australia from winning the second one-dayer by seven wickets on Friday to consolidate their lead in the series.For the second time in three days, India rode Rohits elegant century to post a 300-plus total before watching George Bailey help the hosts mount a clinical chase to put Australia 2-0 up in the five-match series.Rohit showed the kind of form he is in, hitting a sparkling 124 and featuring in century stands with Test skipper Virat Kohli (59) and the selfless Ajinkya Rahane (89) to help India post 308-8.Yet, the satisfaction of a team victory eluded him as Bailey (76 not out) saw Australia home after Aaron Finch and Shaun Marsh had given the hosts a 145-run opening stand.Mahendra Singh Dhoni opted to bat after winning his second toss of the series and opener Shikhar Dhawan again fell cheaply to pace with Joel Paris claiming his first ODI wicket in his second match.Rohit and Kohli were once more left to rebuild the innings, which they did with some elegant shot-making.The duo, who had forged a 207-run stand in Indias five-wicket defeat at the WACA, added 125 before Kohli paid the price for attempting to steal a non-existent second run.Rohit was lucky to reach his 10th ODI century, after snickometer confirmed he, then on 89, had edged Paris but Australias caught-behind appeal was turned down by the umpire.Rahane proved a perfect foil for Rohit, shunning risks and still finding the ropes to bring up a run-a-ball fifty in their 121-run stand when boundaries flowed from both ends.Rohits 127-ball knock ended in bizarre circumstances when Rahanes straight drive brushed bowler James Faulkners fingers before hitting the stumps with the non-striker out of his crease.After stemming the tourists run flow in the last 10 overs, Australia returned for a strong start to their chase with Finch and Marsh denying India an early breakthrough with some fluent yet risk-free batting.To make things worse, Ishant Sharma dropped Marsh when the batsman was 19. Australias opening pair eventually fell in quick succession after identical knocks of 71, but Bailey added 78 runs with skipper Steven Smith (46) and George Maxwell (26 not out) hit the winning run to complete the chase with one over to spare.Bailey followed his 112 in Perth with a 58-ball knock that included six boundaries and a six.Melbourne hosts the third match on Sunday.

"AUCKLAND: Paceman Mohammad Amir claimed a wicket on his return to international cricket following a five-year ban as Pakistan registered a 16-run victory over New Zealand in the first Twenty20 International in Auckland on Friday.Playing his first match for Pakistan after being banned for taking payments to bowl no-balls, the 23-year-old toiled without much luck before claiming a wicket off his final delivery to finish with figures of 1-31.Home skipper Kane Williamson (70) and Colin Munro (56) had seemingly set New Zealand on course to reach the 172-run victory target before their chase stalled and the hosts were dismissed for 155 in exactly 20 overs.After being asked to bat, former captain Mohammad Hafeez (61) helped the tourists overcome a slow start, hitting Trent Boult for back-to-back fours and clobbering Corey Anderson for two boundaries and a six in the same over.Pakistan skipper Shahid Afridi (23) hit two sixes and a couple of fours in the same Matt Henry over in a typically busy eight-ball knock, while Umar Akmal (24) chipped in with a 14-ball cameo to help Pakistan put up a competitive 171-8 total.Amir received visa clearance for New Zealand only last week and appeared nervous with the new ball in his hand, starting with a wide and soon opting for a change of ends.However, he came close to claiming a wicket in his second over but Afridi spilled a simple catch to reprieve Williamson, then on five.Batting at the other end, Munro decided to counter-attack, belting three sixes and a four off the last four deliveries of Umar Guls second over en route to a 25-ball fifty.Pakistan regained control of the contest when Wahab Riaz (3-34) ended Munros eventful knock before Afrid dismissed Grant Elliott and Luke Ronchi in the same over to jolt the hosts.Amir endured a second slice of misfortune when Sohaib Maqsood dropped debutant Todd Astle off his bowling before he finally tasted success in the penultimate over, this time Afridi making no mistake in taking the catch to account for Henry.Hamilton hosts the second of three Twenty20 Internationals between the sides on Sunday before they embark on a three-match one-day international series.

"JOHANNESBURG: A venomous spell of fast bowling from Stuart Broad led England to an emphatic seven- wicket win over South Africa in the third Test on Saturday to clinch the series.Broads brilliant return of 6-17 on a lively wicket skittled the Proteas for 83 in their second innings on the third day.England reached their modest victory target of 74 with relative ease as captain Alastair Cook (43) top-scored in guiding them to 77 for three from 22,4 overs under gloomy skies.The tourists now have an unassailable 2-0 lead in the four-match series, with the final game to be played in Pretoria.South Africa bowled out England for 323 in the morning session for a slender first-innings deficit of 10 runs, but were no match for the bounce and movement of a rampant Broad as they crumbled to their second lowest Test score since returning to international cricket in 1991.Broads inspired spell after lunch was reminiscent of his 8-15 against Australia at Trent Bridge last August as he tore through the South African top order aided by some excellent catching.After removing openers Dean Elgar (15) and Stiaan van Zyl (11), Broad grabbed the key wicket of captain AB de Villiers (0) when he induced an inside edge to wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow.It got worse for the home side when their other kingpin Hashim Amla (five) clipped the ball to James Taylor at short-leg, who showed excellent reactions to take a low catch.Temba Bavuma (0) became Broads fifth victim when he tried to evade a lifting delivery, but only succeeded in gloving the ball on to his stumps.Broads brilliant day was completed when he ended the innings with an excellent catch off his own bowling as he dived forward grab a ball that had come off the boot of batsman Faf du Plessis (14).Ben Stokes grabbed two scalps and there were also wickets each for James Anderson and Steven Finn.The latter complained after the innings of tightness on his left-side and will be assessed on Sunday.Rabada, 20, had earlier claimed his first five-wicket haul in test cricket when he bagged 5-78 to limit England to 323.It was a first home series defeat for South Africa against a team other than Australia since England won 2-1 in 2004-05.

"JOHANNESBURG: Stuart Broad decimated South Africas top order with a magical spell of fast bowling that yielded five wickets and left England on the brink of victory at tea on day three of the third Test on Saturday.The hosts limped to the interval on 71 for eight after Broad returned figures of five for 14 from 10 overs on a lively wicket to leave the Proteas with a meagre 61-run lead.Faf du Plessis (12) and Hardus Viljoen (one) will seek to build a ninth-wicket partnership after the interval in an attempt to set a target that gives their bowlers some hope.Resuming after lunch on 16 without loss having bowled England out for 323 in the morning, South Africa had no answer to the bounce and movement of Broad, who moved ahead of Bob Willis into third on the list of all-time England Test wicket-takers with 329.Dean Elgar (15) edged to wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow and another torturous innings from Stiaan van Zyl (11) ended when he spliced the ball to Ben Stokes in the gully.The huge wicket of AB de Villiers (0) followed in Broads next over as he induced an inside edge to the keeper, before Hashim Amla (5) clipped the ball to short leg where James Taylor took a remarkable low catch.There were no second-innings heroics from Temba Bavuma (0) as he attempted to leave a rising delivery but only managed to glove the ball on to his stumps.Broads spell was reminiscent of his eight for 15 against Australia at Trent Bridge last August.There was no let-up for the home side when Broad was rested, Steven Finn removing Dane Vilas (8) thanks to another sensational one-handed catch by Taylor diving to his right.Stokes continued the procession with an excellent in-swinging yorker that clattered into the stumps of Chris Morris (0), before inducing an edge from Kagiso Rabada (16) to Bairstow.The wicketkeeper had scored a brisk 45 to help England to a 10-run first innings lead as Rabada completed a first Test five-wicket haul.The 20-year-old Rabada finished with figures of 5-78 after dismissing Joe Root (110), Broad (12) and Bairstow.England lead the series 1-0 after victory in the first Test by 241 run.

"JOHANNESBURG: Jonny Bairstow scored a brisk 45 to help England to a 10-run first innings lead over South Africa before Kagiso Rabada completed a first Test five-wicket haul on the third day of the third Test at the Wanderers on Saturday.Bairstow added 41 runs to his overnight total to propel England, who resumed the day on 238-5, to 323 despite losing overnight partner Joe Root (110) early in the first session.South Africa, who scored 313 in their first innings, were 16 without loss at lunch as they went about setting England a formidable target to give themselves a chance to level the series.Dean Elgar (10) and Stiaan van Zyl on six were not out at the start of their second innings.The 20-year-old Rabada added three wickets on Saturday to finish with figures of 5-78 as he dismissed Root, Stuart Broad and took the last wicket of Bairstow.Root added just four runs to his overnight total before getting a feint inside edge to an in-swinging delivery as the home side made an early breakthrough on a cloudy morning. He reviewed the umpires decision but technology showed a snick to the delight of home supporters after Root had dominated the second day with his unbeaten century.Moeen Ali (19) dispatched three lusty boundaries in a quick appearance at the wicket before edging a delivery from Chris Morris that saw wicketkeeper Dane Vilas pull off a stunning diving catch. Rabada then bowled Broad with a fullish delivery for 12 as England edged towards South Africas score.Steven Finn got the slightest touch off his gloves to a rising delivery from Morne Morkel and was caught behind without scoring. His dismissal was only confirmed after South Africa reviewed the umpires original not out decision.Bairstow then swung his bat to knock off the deficit and build up a slender lead before pulling high to mid-wicket where Van Zyl caught him to end the innings.England lead the series 1-0 after victory in the first test by 241 run with the second drawn.

"Back-to-back one-day defeats in Perth and Brisbane have forced India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni to rethink his strategy of opting to bat first against Australia, who have taken a 2-0 lead in the five-match series by chasing down 300-plus targets.Dhoni won the toss in both matches and after India posted scores of 309 and 308 and watched as the hosts reeled them in with powerful displays at the crease.There was also a suggestion of a lack of discipline about Indias bowlers, who leaked 23 wides in the two matches.Ahead of Sundays third one-dayer, Dhoni wondered if chasing a target was a better option for India.""I feel even if we cut down the extras we will have to score more runs,"" said Dhoni.""There are two options: either put pressure on the batsmen and score 330, or chase down the score, give them the batting first.We will have a look and decide what suits us the best.""While Rohit Sharma burnished his reputation in limited-overs cricket with a second successive century in Brisbane, skipper Dhoni said he was seeking even more his batsmen.""As a team we have to win, irrespective of which department is not doing well, and for that we have to score 20-30 more runs,"" he added.""That will put a lot of pressure on the batsmen, because the moment you take your guard right from the first ball, on the back of your mind would be we have to get 330-340 odd runs to be on the safer side and that would put a lot of pressure.",1/16/2016,Dhoni may make India chase in third one dayer,cricket,,Rohit;Sharma;Rohit Sharma;Mahendra;Dhoni;Singh;Mahendra Singh Dhoni,Dhoni;Mahendra Singh Dhoni,
"KHULNA: Sabbir Rehman gave an account of his all-round abilities in Bangladesh's 42-run win over Zimbabwe in the second T20 in Khulna. He smacked an unbeaten 43 before picking up the vital wicket of Hamilton Masakadza, one of his three scalps, as the wind was taken out of the visitors' 168-run chase in the ninth over.Soumya Sarkar also made 43, but missed out on a bigger score after he threw his wicket away in the 10th over. Yet, Bangladesh kept hitting the boundaries - they managed 11 fours and eight sixes to equal their own record of most sixes in a T20 innings. Zimbabwe's reply was nearly a mirror image of Bangladesh's first half, until Sabbir came along to seal a victory that gave Bangladesh a 2-0 lead in the four-match series.Bangladesh started well, but the real push came when Tamim Iqbal hammered Neville Madziva for a four and six in the fifth over. But just as he started to rev up his engine, he also found a top edge that was easily taken by Brian Vitori at fine leg in the sixth over.Sarkar also looked authoritative by striking three fours and a six before Tamim fell and he then built the base further with Sabbir. But Sarkar threw it away in the 10th over as Malcolm Waller took an easy catch at deep midwicket to end his promising innings of 43.Zimbabwe were further boosted by the wicket of Mahmudullah, who fell to a superb catch by wicketkeeper Richmond Mutumbami. Then Mushfiqur Rahim batted through the second half of the innings to give Bangladesh a solid total to defend adding 52 for the fourth wicket with Sabbir.Sabbir made the most of a reprieve on 7 by Mutumbami as he lined up the straight boundaries well, even as Mushfiqur used the bowler's pace well in his 20-ball 24 before hobbling off the field. Shakib then finished off the innings with a cameo as Bangladesh took 50 off the last five overs.Masakadza came out all guns blazing, hitting two fours and two sixes in 2.2 overs, while Vusi Sibanda also soon got into the act. Zimbabwe were reprieved twice in the fourth over bowled by Mashrafe Mortaza. First, the substitute Imrul Kayes dropped Masakadza at cover, before Shuvagata couldn't reach a chance at midwicket.But Mashrafe soon had a wicket to show as Sibanda was bowled off the inside edge for 21 off 17. It was then that Sabbir was thrown the ball, and he delivered by having Masakadza caught at long-on for a 28-ball 30 that had three fours and two sixes. Sean Williams fell soon after to give Shuvagata his first T20I wicket and leave Zimbabwe needing a further 103 runs from the last ten overs. Sabbir then had the wicket of Mutumbami, who holed out to Sarkar at deep midwicket.Malcolm Waller briefly kept Zimbabwe in it by striking a four each in the 13th, 14th and 15th over, but an already escalating rate was compounded by Bangladesh's spinners. Waller was eventually dismissed for a 21-ball 29 by Al-Amin Hossain in the 16th over.Mustafizur Rahman then came to the party to dismiss Madziva and Peter Moor in the 17th over to puncture Zimbabwe. The eighth wicket was fittingly taken by Sabbir, who became the second Bangladesh cricketer to score at least 40 and take two wickets in T20.With a series win out of the equation, Zimbabwe have two more matches to potentially get their combinations right leading to the World T20.

"MELBOURNE: Glenn Maxwell struck a scintillating 96 in a tricky chase to help Australia beat India by three wickets in the third one-dayer on Sunday and take an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series.Maxwell revived Australias chase for a 296-run victory target with a spectacular knock and by the time he was dismissed after an 83-ball blitz, scores were tied at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.""It was nice to get a few out of the middle,"" the 27-year-old said at the presentation ceremony. ""I broke my number one bat which was a bit annoying. I have to call Kookaburra and try and get another one from them.""Virat Kohli had earlier struck a run-a-ball 117 to power India to a competitive 295 for six but the total was not enough in the end.Put into bat, India suffered an early setback as the law of average caught up with opener Rohit Sharma who, after centuries in the last two matches, fell for six in the fifth over.However, Shikhar Dhawan (68), now a Melbourne resident, batted himself back into form, raising 119 runs with Kohli before exposing his leg-stump which was pegged back by a John Hastings delivery.At the other end, Kohli became the fastest to score 7,000-runs in one-dayers, taking five less than the 166 innings South African AB de Villiers needed to reach the mark.The Indian test skipper found an able ally in Ajinkya Rahane (50), who notched up his second successive fifty, as the duo added 109 runs.Hastings, who finished with a career-best 4-58, ended Kohlis sparkling knock of 117 that included two sixes and seven boundaries.Dropped on 20, Aaron Finch (21) could not make the most of the reprieve but Shaun Marsh (62) and skipper Steven Smith (41) added 64 runs to steady the Australia reply.At 215-6, the hosts looked in trouble before Maxwell bailed them out with some uninhibited stroke-making.Needing 65 runs off the last 10 overs, Maxwell hit Umesh Yadav for a six and a four in the 43rd over that produced 15 runs and proved the turning point in the thrilling contest.Maxwell missed his second ODI ton but belted three sixes and eight boundaries in his stellar knock to claim the man-of-the-match award as the hosts romped home with seven balls to spare.The teams now move to Canberra for the fourth one-dayer on Wednesday.

"HAMILTON: Skipper Kane Williamson and fellow opener Martin Guptill forged the highest partnership in Twenty20 Internationals to secure New Zealand a series-levelling 10-wicket victory against Pakistan in the second match in Hamilton on Sunday.The 171-run stand between the pair, who shared the man-of-the-match award, bettered the previous record of 170 between South African openers Graeme Smith and Loots Bosman against England in a 2009 match at Centurion.Opting to bat first, Pakistan posted 168 for seven in 20 overs with Umar Akmal (56 not out) and Shoaib Malik (39) scoring the bulk of the runs in the second match of the three-game series.Akmal needed 22 balls for his fifty and hit four sixes as Pakistan settled for a score their bowlers eventually could not defend.The tourists struggled to come to terms with the contrasting batting styles of New Zealands opening pair who milked the Pakistan attack with consummate ease.Williamson hit 11 boundaries to remain unbeaten on 72 as his team sealed victory with 14 balls to spare.Guptill faced 10 more balls for his 87 not out, hitting four sixes and nine boundaries, the last of which sealed victory and created a new partnership record.Wellington hosts the decider on Friday.

"SYDNEY: Big financial incentives for gamblers, small tournaments of little consequence to top players and the ease of fixing the outcome of a one-on-one sport have helped turn world tennis into a haven for match-fixers, according to experts and industry insiders.Tennis was rocked on Monday by allegations that the games authorities have failed to deal with widespread match-fixing, just as the Australian Open, the first grand slam tournament of the year, kicked off in Melbourne.Multiple sources told Reuters that the revelation was no surprise to those who closely follow the sport, where, out of the spotlight at small tournaments around the world, the temptations are obvious and malfeasance very difficult to prove.Dozens of untelevised tournaments are held annually and top players often inexplicably lose to relatively unknown opponents, said Steve Georgakis, a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney, who is researching match-fixing in tennis.""If you have a look at the big tournaments, the Opens or Olympic Games, youll notice that in a lot of these tournaments the favourite usually wins,"" he said.But at a small tournament the following week, how could anyone prove that a top 50 player didnt lose because they were exhausted or injured, said Georgakis.A highly ranked player is almost certain to be the odds-on favourite to win in these small tournaments and thus has the greatest opportunity to make money by intentionally losing to an outmatched player, handing a big payoff to those behind the fix.""Its a one-on-one sport and what you do is, youre the favourite and you get a few other people to load up on the other player to win and then you throw the match.And you can never get caught,"" Georgakis added.Sports betting has exploded in recent years with the proliferation of online and mobile gambling sites, and could be worth as much as $3 trillion annually, Patrick Jay, an independent betting expert, told the United Nations in 2015.In that sea of money, tennis is the second most active betting market, trailing only soccer, research conducted by the European Gaming and Betting Association shows.Betting on tennis is relatively simple and comes with enormous potential payoffs, a professional tennis gambler told Reuters under the condition of anonymity.Many bookmakers have created disincentives to bet point-by-point or game-by-game with limits on those types of bets, pushing gamblers towards the payoffs for a winning bet on the overall match.""Say you want to throw a game but win the match, why would you bother? You can only win a couple of thousand of dollars,"" the gambler said.Bookmakers are obliged to report suspicious betting patterns to the Tennis Integrity Unit, which was set up to police illegal activities in world tennis.But a source at a major bookmaker told Reuters under the condition of anonymity that it is ultimately up to the authorities to act.""Most money is won by betting on the favourite, which is not a good result for bookmakers,"" he added.""But if hes up one set to love and then, in play, people start betting on the outsiderthat would be us getting on the front foot, most likely, to say (to the authorities) is there anything you need for us to look into?,"" the bookmaker said.",1/18/2016,World tennis has been ripe for match fixing,tennis,SYDNEY,Patrick Jay;Patrick;Jay;Steve;Steve Georgakis;Georgakis,,European Gaming and Betting Association;United Nations;Reuters;University of Sydney
"MELBOURNE: Johanna Konta did not have to wait long after her stunning first round upset of Venus Williams at the Australian Open on Tuesday before having to field the inevitable questions about her national allegiance.Born and raised until her early teens in Sydney, the 24-year-old world number 47 moved to Britain in 2005 and plays under the flag of her adopted home.That background was not about to escape the attention of the local media, particularly after the impressive nature of her 6-4 6-2 win over the seven-times grand slam champion and former world number one.Asked whether she might consider switching her allegiance back to Australia, Konta was blunt. ""No,"" she said.""Unfortunately, my home is Great Britain. It has been for a long time now, over a decade. Yeah, no, thats where my heart is.""Ah, jealousy is not a good thing,"" she grinned, as the questioner pursued the point by contrasting her victory with former U.S. Open champion Sam Stosurs first round exit.""I think Australian tennis is doing quite well, to be honest.""You have a number of very good players, and its -- whats the word? Its not a privilege, but its a compliment that you guys would say that, so thank you. But be grateful for what you guys have.""Apart from the local verbal tick of beginning her answers with a ""yeah, no"", Konta has gained more obvious benefits from her time in Australia.""My ability to deal with the heat,"" she said. ""I think Im very lucky that I got to spend a lot of my young years here, because I got obviously exposed to the heat out here.""That was particularly beneficial on Tuesday when temperatures crept towards the 30 degrees Celsius mark on Rod Laver Arena.Because of her nationality switch, Konta is unlikely to be back on the main show court for her second round encounter with Carina Witthoeft or Zheng Saisai.

"ISLAMABAD: British boxer of Pakistan origin Amir Khan who holds a record 31-3 with 19 knockouts will be the mandatory challenger for the winner of the fight between Danny Garcia and Roberto Guerrero scheduled to be held on Saturday.After Floyd Mayweather Jr. announced his retirement last September the title was vacated.Garcia and Guerrero will be fist to fist on January 23 for the said vacant WBC welterweight title at the Staples Center in Los Angeles California.In their official announcement WBC said Danny Garcia vs. Robert Guerrero will fight for the WBC welterweight championship.Amir Khan is ratified as (WBC) mandatory contender.Lamont Peterson vs. Andre Berto for a final elimination bout to determine the second mandatory website www.vinereport.com, reported on Tuesday.The decision of the organization met criticisms including comments from ESPN analyst Dan Rafael.Although the lineup looks more favorable for Khan he is more focused on Guerrero getting another chance with the title after his several attempts in the past.He said Anyone with remote knowledge of recent results would have to scratch their head with regard to Guerrero getting a title shot when you consider he had his clock cleaned in a one sided loss to Keith Thurman in March for another organization s welterweight title.Guerrero currently holds a record of 33-3 1 with 18 knockouts but was easily defeated by Mayweather Jr. in their welterweight title bout in 2013. He also had another chance to get the title from a different organization with his fight against Keith Thruman last March and a close shave with Aaron Martinez in June.He was as lucky as whomever will win the Powerball jackpot when he was given a generous split decision against Aaron Martinez in June but even if you can stomach Guerrero in a world title fight the WBC clearly is violating its rules since it only ranks Guerrero sixth Rafael added.Meanwhile in case Garcia gets the win it will be the second time that he and Khan will fight against a title.Garcia who holds the record 31-0 with 18 knockout victories already fought with Khan for the junior welterweight title in 2012.",1/19/2016,Amir Khan to take on Garcia Guerrero fight winner,boxing,ISLAMABAD,Martinez;Rafael;Roberto Guerrero;Danny Garcia;Danny;Robert;Floyd;Floyd Mayweather Jr.;Thurman;Thruman;Amir Khan;Roberto;Keith;Garcia;Jr.;championship.Amir;Khan;Peterson;Mayweather;Aaron;Aaron Martinez;Andre Berto;Keith Thurman;Keith Thruman;Amir;Guerrero;Andre;Dan;Robert Guerrero;championship.Amir Khan;Berto;Mayweather Jr.,Amir Khan;Garcia Guerrero,WBC;ESPN
"MELBOURNE: Australia off-spinner Nathan Hauritz announced his retirement from competitive cricket on Tuesday, bringing the curtain down on a 15-year career during which he represented the national side in all three formats.Hauritz, one of the many spinners Australia turned to after the retirement of bowling great Shane Warne, did not have a state contract for the last two seasons and was used by his Big Bash League side Melbourne Renegades for one match this season.The 34-year-old failed to take a wicket in that clash, against Perth Scorchers, and conceded 29 runs in his two overs.""I was just so shattered after the game,"" he told reporters. ""I realised I hadnt come down here to be that disappointed about a game of cricket anymore. I thought I dont need that anymore. I just want to get away.""The highs and lows (are too much).

"MELBOURNE: Fernando Verdasco sent shockwaves through the Australian Open on Tuesday by defeating Rafael Nadal 7-6(6) 4-6 3-6 7-6(4) 6-2 to send the former world number one crashing out in the opening round.The first-round exit was the 2009 champion's first at Melbourne Park and only his second at such an early stage in a grand slam.Down 2-0 in the final set, world number 45 Verdasco dragged himself off the canvas with a barrage of booming forehand winners, breaking Nadal twice to move to the brink of victory.He then broke his compatriot a third time, sealing the four hour and 41-minute classic with a cross-court winner that left the Rod Laver Arena crowd stunned late in the day session.""I just hit everything. I think I played unbelievable in the fifth set from the break,"" Verdasco said in a courtside interview.""I just started hitting winners. I don't know how. I was closing the eyes and everything when I was coming in.""I kept doing it so it went well.""After shaking hands with his opponent and the chair umpire Nadal strode quickly off the court, barely pausing to acknowledge the crowd with a wave.The only other time Nadal was beaten so early in a grand slam was when Steve Darcis sent him crashing out of Wimbledon in 2013.""The match is five sets... he was playing amazing in the last set,"" Nadal told reporters. ""He had a lot of success all the balls hitting full power in the fifth.""strong>'HAPPY FEELINGS'</strongBefore the tournament, Nadal had spoken of bringing ""happy feelings"" to Melbourne Park, after arriving his healthiest in years following a taxing off-season training camp.But his exit will do little to dispel the belief that the 14-times grand slam champion's best days are behind him.Nadal failed to progress further than the quarter-final of any of the grand slams last season, his first without a major trophy since 2004.Verdasco was inspired, however, hauling himself back from the brink with a stand-and-deliver game that mixed 90 winners with 91 unforced errors.It was partial revenge for his loss in an epic five-set semi-final against Nadal in the 2009 tournament, the second longest match recorded at the Australian Open.The 32-year-old served masterfully in each tiebreak, particularly in the second to keep the match alive, but wobbled early in the fifth when he was broken early.Fortune often plays a part in the defeat of Nadal and so it proved for Verdasco, who swung wildly at a second serve with the frame of his racquet, sending the ball cross-court to clip the line and break back to 2-2.He raised his hands in apology before acing Nadal to nudge ahead and ramped up the aggression on his more fancied opponent's serve.The pressure told on Nadal, who made his sixth double-fault to concede a break point, and Verdasco outfoxed the Spaniard in a fierce baseline rally to capture the decisive break.A raging ball of fire, Verdasco roared on to complete one of his finest victories and land a hammer blow on Nadal's early season confidence.""It's tough especially because it's not like (it) was here last year,"" added Nadal, who was beaten by Tomas Berdych in the quarter-finals a year ago.""This year was a completely different story -- I had been playing and practising great and working so much, so it's tough when you work so much and you arrive at a very important event and you go out so early.""",1/19/2016,Sublime Verdasco sends Nadal to early Melbourne exi,tennis,MELBOURNE,Berdych;Rafael;Nadal;Fernando Verdasco;Rafael Nadal;Tomas Berdych;Darcis;Verdasco;Steve;Steve Darcis;Tomas;Fernando,Nadal;Verdasco;Rafael Nadal;Fernando Verdasco,
"FIFA's Sepp Blatter may have been banned for eight years from the game but he is still receiving his president's salary from world soccer's governing body, a spokesman for FIFA's Audit and Compliance Committee told Reuters on Monday.Blatter was suspended for 90 days by FIFA on Oct 8 and then banned from the game for eight years last month for ethics violations over a $2 million payment FIFA made to European soccer boss Michel Platini with Blatter's approval in 2011.But Blatter, a Swiss national who has been president of FIFA since 1998, will continue to be paid until a new president is elected on Feb 26, the spokesman Andreas Bantel said. That would mean Blatter would have been paid for nearly five months during which time he was unable to carry out his duties, and a period in which FIFA has appointed an acting president, African soccer head Issa Hayatou.The compensation sub-committee of FIFA's Audit and Compliance Committee recently ruled that it could stop Blatter's bonuses but not, according to his contract, his salary.""Until the election of a new president on February 26, Mr Blatter is the elected president and therefore - according to his contract - is entitled to receive his remuneration,"" Bantel said.Blatter's U.S. lawyer and his Switzerland-based spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment.FIFA is facing the worst corruption crisis in it history as a total of 41 individuals and entities, including many former FIFA officials, have been charged with corruption-related offences in the United States. The U.S. investigation is far from over and FIFA also faces a parallel Swiss probe.Blatter's bonuses have been stopped because he was not carrying out his duties of supervising the organization, including its general secretary.Only last week, FIFA announced that Jerome Valcke was fired from his position as general secretary.

"MELBOURNE: Former golden girl Eugenie Bouchards hopes of rehabilitation at the Australian Open came to a swift end on Wednesday as wily Agnieszka Radwanska sent the Canadian spinning out of the tournament with a 6-4 6-2 defeat in the second round.The 21-year-old Bouchard, whose career hit the buffers last year following her break-out 2014 season when she reached the Wimbledon final, crumbled under the lights of Rod Laver Arena after sprinting into a 4-2 lead in the first set.She lost six straight games to gift the set and an early break in the second to the Polish fourth seed, and was then powerless to mount a challenge as her forehand misfired and the errors started piling up.Staring down the barrel at 5-2, Bouchard was presented with one last chance to rally, having prised three break-points as Radwanska served for the match.But the 37th-ranked Canadian squandered them all in a run of four unforced errors, capitulating meekly at the tournament that was the springboard for her sensational 2014.""I definitely felt in control at that moment .You cant ever back off her and give her a chance to breathe,"" Bouchard explained to reporters about her failure to capitalise on such an encouraging start in the night session match.Bouchard made the semi-finals at Melbourne Park and the French Open that year before going one better at Wimbledon, prompting pundits and former players to declare her a future grand slam champion.Reaching a peak of world number five, she made the Australian Open quarter-finals last year before the wheels fell off with first-round exits at the French Open and Wimbledon.A more promising run to the fourth round of the U. S. Open ended in drama when she slipped and fell on the locker room floor and had to withdraw from the tournament with concussion.She later sued the United States Tennis Association and was unable to complete a match for the rest of the year.Though speaking of new beginnings in Australia and bringing a new coach in former Maria Sharapova mentor Thomas Hogstedt, Bouchard appeared to arrive with other baggage.Her encouraging run to the final of the Hobart International was ended with a 6-1 6-2 meltdown against Frenchwoman Alize Cornet, and she complained of being distracted by ""personal family issues"" at home.However, she tried to remain upbeat after her loss to Radwanska.

"PRETORIA: Stephen Cook became the 100th batsman to score a debut Test century and his innings of 115 helped South Africa amass 329 for five on the first day of the final Test against England on Friday in their bid to salvage pride in a lost series.Hashim Amla scored his 25th Test century as he and Cook shared a second-wicket stand of 202 but captain AB de Villiers departed second ball on a day of contrasting fortunes as England, 2-0 up in the four-Test series, fought back to claim four wickets after tea.Temba Bavuma (32) and Quinton de Kock (25) were not out at the close of play at Centurion Park.Handed his debut at the age of 33, one of five South Africa changes from the team badly beaten in the third Test in Johannesburg last week, Cook brought his domestic form to the test arena with a dream start to his international career.He survived two dropped catches, two close run-out calls and an lbw appeal unsuccessfully reviewed by England before reaching three figures -- a nervous spell in the 90s exacerbated by the departures of Amla and De Villiers.But Cook, whose father Jimmy was dismissed first ball on his debut for South Africa in 1992 at the age of 39, looked organised from the start, hitting a four off the first ball of the match when James Andersons delivery strayed down leg side.He should have been out on 47 but was dropped by wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow off Stuart Broads bowling. He was eventually bowled after an innings of 187 balls when he got an inside edge to a delivery from Chris Woakes.Amla, who gave up the captaincy after the second Test to concentrate on his batting, looked effortless as he raced to three figures, scoring 109 off 168 balls with 19 boundaries before he played on to Ben Stokes.De Villiers, captain for his second Test, was out for his second duck in successive innings, caught at second slip by Joe Root off Broad.Yet another freakish catch by James Taylor at short leg dismissed Dean Elgar for 20 for the first wicket of the day as the short leg fielder continued a run of spectacular dismissals in the series.JP Duminy was Moeen Alis second wicket, trapped lbw for 16 -- the last wicket of the day as England checked South Africas progress after they had look poised for a huge total on 237 for one.

"PRETORIA: Hashim Amla scored an unbeaten century and Stephen Cook was 91 not out to lead South Africa to 224 for one at tea on the first day of the final Test against England as the hosts bid to salvage pride in a lost series.Amlas 25th Test century came off 131 balls in a confident display which brought him 18 fours while Cook was nine runs short of a debut Test century at Centurion Park on Friday.Amla, who gave up the captaincy after the second Test to concentrate on his batting, looked effortless as he raced to three figures to cheers South Africa who lost two of the first three Tests and the series.He was 102 not out at the interval.Cook, handed his debut at the age of 33 in one of five South Africa changes after defeat in Johannesburg last week, offered a straightforward chance after lunch when he got a healthy edge to a Stuart Broad delivery but was dropped by wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow on 47.There was another more difficult opportunity for Bairstow down the leg side when Cook was on 76. But Cook, whose father Jimmy was dismissed first ball when he made his debut for South Africa in 1992 at the age of 39, looked organised at the crease as he brought to the Test arena his dominant form in domestic competition.He hit a four off the first ball of the match when James Andersons delivery strayed down leg side.Yet another freakish catch by James Taylor at short leg was the only positive moment of the day for England as Dean Elgar was dismissed for 20 in unusual circumstances before lunch.Taylor showed a sharp presence of mind to grasp a catch after Elgars stinging shot hit him in the leg and the ball somehow got stuck around his calf, allowing him to snatch it up before it dropped to the ground.Elgar had danced down to wicket to Moeen Ali, hitting with some power, and will count himself exceedingly unlucky to have been dismissed after a lengthy review of the television evidence by the third umpire.It was the third extraordinary catch in the last two Tests for the diminutive Taylor, thriving in the most dangerous position on the field.South Africa won the toss and had no hesitation in electing to take first use of a good batting wicket.Their advantage was increased by a poor England bowling display with too many balls drifting down the leg-side or pitched too short.

"PRETORIA: Dean Elgar fell to a freak catch but debutant Stephen Cook remained unbeaten on 46 to help South Africa reach 107 for one at lunch on the opening day of the fourth and final Test against England at Centurion Park on Friday.Hashim Amla was batting on 34 at the break, having added 72 runs with Cook for the flourishing second wicket partnership after Elgar was dismissed for 20.James Taylor, at short leg, showed good anticipation and presence of mind when Elgars stinging shot hit him in the leg and the ball somehow got stuck around his calf, allowing him to pluck it before it could drop on the ground.Elgar had danced down to wicket to Moeen Ali and will count himself exceedingly unlucky to have been dismissed after a lengthy review by the television umpire.It was the third extraordinary catch in the last two Tests for the diminutive Taylor, thriving in the most dangerous position on the field.Cook began his Test career hitting four off the first ball of the game as James Andersons opening delivery strayed down leg side.It set the tone for the opening session with England being inconsistent with their bowling line, often drifting down the leg-side and erring in length on the short side.The 33-year-old Cook, whose father Jimmy was dismissed first ball when he debuted for South Africa in 1992 at the age of 39, was one of five changes from the third Test made by the home team.South Africa captain AB de Villiers won the toss and elected to bat on a wicket expected to provide for ideal batting on the opening day.England, who have taken an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series, made just one change to their team with seamer Chris Woakes, who played in the first Test, coming in for the injured Steven Finn.

"KHULNA: First it was Hamilton Masakadza, who scored a record-breaking 93 to help Zimbabwe post a formidable total. Then came Tendai Chisoro's three-wicket haul that applied the brakes on Bangladesh's chase of 181 as the visitors levelled the series at 2-2 with an 18-run win in Khulna.While Chisoro picked up the key wickets of Sabbir Rahman and Shakib Al Hasan, and Mahmudullah, Neville Madziva, the pacer, did the damage at the start and towards the end as Bangladesh were bowled out for 162 in 19 overs to lose by 18 runs.Bangladesh's chase started badly as the top four were blown away with just 17 on the board. Mahmudullah and Imrul Kayes tried to resurrect the innings; Kayes slamming two fours and a six to briefly get the crowd going. But an attempted hoick over deep midwicket brought an end to his innings for a 14-ball 18 in the seventh over.Mahmudullah, meanwhile, rode luck found boundaries through edges and clips, but he soon got into his zone by hammering sixes over deep midwicket and long-off. Along the way, he was also a recipient of a huge slice of luck when he was dropped by Vusi Sibanda on 13.Nurul Hasan and Mahmudullah added 57 runs in 6.3 overs as the scales started to tilt again. But Sikander Raza revived Zimbabwe's hopes as he had Nurul, who was caught at cover. Mashrafe Mortaza, who has shown ability to wield the long handle, struck him for a four and six in the same over to reduce the equation down to 60 off the last six overs.A hint of panic endured as Elton Chigumbura threw the ball to his frontline spinner Graeme Cremer. Panic turned into proper nerves as he too was tonked for six by Mashrafe. But one slog too many resulted in Mahmudullah's downfall at the other end as he missed a full ball from Chisoro. Abu Hider Rony swung his way around, but he his effort had to be consigned to being scant consolation for the hosts. He was the last man to fall as Luke Jongwe held on to a low catch at cover to complete the win.The game started differently for Zimbabwe as they lost an early wicket, but Richmond Mutumbami and Masakadza got them up and running with a brisk 80-run stand. Mutumbami was also reprieved by Taskin Ahmed at short fine leg to add to Bangladesh's woes.Masakadza brought out his entire range of strokes, using a combination of brute force and timing to negotiate Bangladesh's spinners on a slow deck. He too was reprieved on 36 as the hosts suddenly went off the boil. Despite dismissing Mutumbami for a 25-ball 32, Bangladesh didn't look like getting control as Malcolm Waller blasted his way to an 18-ball 36 to strengthen Zimbabwe's base.On the night, the final flourish proved enough as Zimbabwe ran away emphatic winners as they restored parity to head into the World T20 with some confidence restored following a demoralising limited-overs series loss to Afghanistan earlier in the month.

"SYDNEY: Manish Pandey struck his maiden one-day century in a high-scoring thriller to secure India a pride-salvaging six-wicket victory against Australia in the fifth and final ODI in Sydney on Saturday.Staring at a series whitewash after four defeats, India rode Pandeys scintillating 104 off 81 balls to chase down a 331-run victory target with two balls to spare.Centuries from David Warner (122) and Mitchell Marsh (102) helped Australia post 330-7 but Pandeys knock in his only fourth one-dayer clinched the contest for India.India needed a strong start from their openers to stay on course to chase down such a big total and the visitors got just that from Shikhar Dhawan (78) and Rohit Sharma (99).Dhawan posted his third successive 50-plus score and Rohit fell agonisingly short of his third century in the series as they raised 123 runs in 18.2 overs.John Hastings dismissed Dhawan and Virat Kohli (eight) in quick successions to halt Indias progress and Rohit left leaving India needing exactly 100 runs from 91 balls to win the contest.With the required run-rate skyrocketing and skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (34) struggling to time the ball at the other end, Pandeys crisp hitting left India needing 13 runs off the last over from Marsh.Marsh began with a wide and had his next hit out of the ground by Dhoni but the Indian captain fell immediately to inject fresh drama in the contest.Pandey, however, was unfazed and he hit the next ball for a boundary to first complete his century and then scurried for two for the winning run.Earlier, Warner struck his fifth ODI century and Mitchell Marsh notched up his first to set up yet another runfest in a series that has provided 3,159 runs.Indias much-maligned bowlers did well to reduce Australia to 117-4 in the 22nd over before Warner and Marsh combined to add 118 runs in 17.3 overs.Warner had fallen seven runs short of a century in Wednesdays fourth ODI at Canberra but there was no such heartbreak this time as the southpaw brought up his run-a-ball century.The 27-year-old opener was eventually dismissed for 122, that included thee sixes and nine boundaries, but Marsh carried on to remain not out on 102 off 84 balls.For India, Jasprit Bumrah made an impressive debut, the right-arm paceman with an unorthodox bowling action sending down 10 tidy overs to claim 2-40 with some tight death bowling.Pandey was adjudged man-of-the-match, while team mate Rohit won the man-of-the-series award for the 441 runs he amassed in five matches.

"PRETORIA: England lost opener Alex Hales cheaply and were 29 for one at tea after bowling South Africa out for 475 on the second day of the final Test at Centurion Park on Saturday.Captain Alastair Cook (14) and Nick Compton (0) were not out after Hales continued his unconvincing form, falling for 15 when he was caught at point by Dane Piedt off Kagiso Rabada in the fifth over.England were still 446 runs behind after Quinton de Kock finished 129 not out to become the third South African centurion of the innings and moving rapidly on from 85 at lunch.He brought up his maiden Test century from 104 balls in an aggressive innings before running out of partners.A stand of 50 for the eighth wicket with Kyle Abbott and 82 for the ninth with Piedt kept England in the field a lot longer than they had planned.Frustration for the tourists, already 2-0 up in the series, was exacerbated by dropped catches, including two off De Kock.De Kocks century followed tons on the first day for Hashim Amla and debutant Stephen Cook, offering South Africa hope of a first Test win in more than 12 months and some consolation after losing the series.England had looked likely to wrap up the South African innings swiftly when they took two wickets in the first four overs under sunny skies.Temba Bavuma added only three to his overnight 32 before getting a faint edge to a leg cutter from Stuart Broad and Rabada was out first ball, trapped lbw to give James Anderson his only wicket of the innings.Abbott fell lbw to Ben Stokes for 16 and Piedt played a dogged innings of 19 off 104 balls in supporting De Kock before Stokes snagged him too.The England all-rounder finished with figures of 4-86 when he trapped Morne Morkel lbw.

"West Indies batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul has officially retired from international cricket, seven months after selectors opted to discard the veteran and push for a youth-oriented policy.Chanderpaul, who was dumped before the home series against Australia last June, said at the time he felt he deserved the opportunity to play one final series despite a poor return in domestic cricket before the squad was selected.The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) thanked him for his contribution to their game.""The WICB acknowledges the invaluable contribution Shiv has made to the game globally and we wish him all the best,"" WICB President Dave Cameron said in a statement.The 41-year-old made his test debut against England in 1994 and went on to amass 11,867 runs at an average of 51.37 in his 164 tests for the Caribbean side.His total is the seventh highest of all time, and he finished behind Brian Laras 11,953 as the second most prolific West Indian batsman.He scored 30 test centuries and 66 half centuries and had a high score of 203 not out.He also scored 8,778 runs in 268 one-day internationals at 41.60.Chanderpauls ungainly batting stance was at odds with crickets coaching manuals, but soft hands and a superb eye allowed him to flick, dab and poke the ball into gaps in the field and quietly accumulate runs.A low conversion rate of 50s to 100s early in his career was rectified after foot surgery removed some floating bone chips and allowed him to play without pain.Chanderpauls calm demeanour held together an increasingly brittle West Indies batting lineup after the retirement of Lara and many opposition teams targeted him as the key wicket.While selectors continue to pursue their youth policy in a bid to rebuild the once powerful cricketing side, Chanderpaul was still playing domestic first class cricket earlier this week.",1/23/2016,Windies Chanderpaul retires from internati,cricket,,Lara;Brian;Laras;Chanderpaul;Shivnarine Chanderpaul;Brian Laras;Dave Cameron;Shivnarine;Dave;Cameron,Windies Chanderpaul,West Indies Cricket Board;West Indies;WICB
"PRETORIA: South African fast bowler Kagiso Rabada took a career-best 6-101 to leave England on 318 for eight wickets at tea and trailing by 157 runs on the third day of the fourth and final Test at Centurion Park on Sunday.Rabada had decimated the England middle-order before lunch, claiming the big wicket of Ben Stokes (33) during a rain-hit middle session, with the visitors reeling after the Proteas posted 475 in their first innings.Moeen Ali (45 not out) provided a steady hand in response and along with Stuart Broad (four not out) will look to close the gap on a wicket that was starting to favour the bowlers.England have already wrapped up the series with an unassailable 2-0 lead.Stokes looked at his fluent best before he was caught at slip by Hashim Amla shortly after South Africa, who posted a first innings total of 475, had taken the new ball.Chris Woakes (26) was the only other wicket to fall in the session and could count himself unlucky, an edge off the part-time spin of JP Duminy hitting the thigh of wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock and looping to Dean Elgar at slip.Rabada had removed Joe Root (76), James Taylor (14) and Jonny Bairstow (0) in quick succession in the minutes before lunch.Root had looked set for a big score but was caught by De Kock having a drive at Rabada after he had brought up his fourth half-century of the series.Taylor fell to the same combination trying to pull a short ball, before Bairstow got a feather edge through to De Kock.Rabada is just the second player in history to take six wickets in an innings in both tests and One-Day Internationals before the age of 21, joining Pakistan great Waqar Younis on that short list.Captain Alastair Cook (76) was the first wicket to fall on day three when he was caught behind by De Kock off the bowling of fast bowler Morne Morkel.Coming around the wicket to the left-hander, Morkel angled the ball into Cooks body and induced an edge as it moved away slightly off the wicket.It left Cook still 41 runs shy of becoming the first England batsman to reach 10,000 test runs after he had put on 99 for the third wicket with Root.

"MELBOURNE: Anna-Lena Friedsams giant-killing run at the Australian Open ended in tears and injury on Sunday when ailments to both legs allowed world number four Agnieszka Radwanska to snatch a 6-7 (6) 6-1 7-5 fourth round win.The 21-year-old German, who had never been past the second round of a grand slam before this years tournament, had Radwanska on the ropes when she led 5-2 in the deciding set before injury cruelly struck at 5-4.The 82nd-ranked Friedsam, who beat U.S. Open finalist Roberta Vinci in the third round, then took an injury time out and had strapping applied to her left leg.Radwanska held serve in the next game, but Friedsam appeared to exacerbate her injury.The German was given a time warning on the first point of the next game when she was unable to serve and broke into tears.She managed to play on and was 15-40 down when she appeared to strain her right hamstring.Chair umpire Felix Torralba then sanctioned her again for exceeding the time limit and awarded Radwanska a point that sealed the game and gave her a 6-5 advantage.The trainer again visited Friedman, who was in constant tears on her chair, but she managed to hobble out and complete the match and was given a massive cheer by the Hisense Arena crowd for her efforts.Radwanska will now meet Spains Carla Suarez-Navarro, who beat Australias Daria Gavrilova 0-6 6-3 6-2, in the last eight.The Pole, who had to play through the pain of a leg injury in the third round, said she had felt a twinge of sympathy for her hobbled opponent but also needed to be ruthless to advance.""Of course, its hard to see that,"" said Radwanska, a semi-finalist at Melbourne Park in 2014.""Its tough because you know someone is struggling.

"PRETORIA: South African fast bowler Kagiso Rabada struck three times shortly before lunch to leave England teetering on 211 for six wickets on the third day of the fourth Test at Centurion Park on Sunday.Rabada removed Englands rock Joe Root (76), James Taylor (14) and Jonny Bairstow (0) with the tourists trailing by 264 runs after South Africa posted a first innings total of 475 on a wicket that is starting to favour the bowlers.In-form Ben Stokes (one) and Moeen Ali (zero) will seek to repair the damage after the interval with the first target to score the 65 runs required to avoid the follow-on.Rabada went to the interval with figures of 5-76, another sign of the rich potential of the 20-year-old who got movement at pace off the wicket to leave his side in control.Captain Alastair Cook (76) was the first wicket to fall in the opening session of the day when he was caught behind by wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock off the bowling of tall fast bowler Morne Morkel.Coming around the wicket to the left-hander, Morkel angled the ball into Cooks body and induced an edge as it moved away slightly off the wicket.It left Cook still 41 runs shy of becoming the first England batsman to reach 10,000 test runs after he had put on 99 for the third wicket with Root.Root and Taylor moved the score on to 208 before the former was caught by De Kock having a drive at Rabada after he had brought up his fourth half-century of the series.That wicket started a precession in the minutes before lunch as Taylor fell to the same combination trying to pull a short ball.South Africas successful morning was complete when Bairstow got a feather edge through to De Kock as a rampant Rabada tore through the middle-order.

"PRETORIA: Firebrand fast bowler Kagiso Rabada bagged two wickets as South Africa reduced England to 52 for three at the close of day four of the final Test on Monday.The tourists, who have already won the series, need a further 330 for what would be a record-breaking victory on the final day but must do so on a wicket showing variable bounce and prodigious turn at Centurion Park.Englands hopes of an unlikely victory or survival will rest on Joe Root (19 not out) who is at the crease with James Taylor (19 not out) after Rabada gave the hosts the perfect start.The 20-year-old forced another failure from opener Alex Hales who was trapped lbw for one by a ball that kept low and jagged into him.Rabada claimed his ninth wicket of the match when he had Nick Compton (six) caught behind, the England batsman unsuccessfully reviewing what seemed an obvious edge.With a tense final day likely, England will hope that wasted review does not come back to haunt them.In between, Morne Morkel grabbed the prize scalp of England captain Alastair Cook (five) with a brilliant one-handed caught and bowled to leave the latter still 36 runs short of 10,000 test runs after a poor series.South Africa should have celebrated the wicket of Root as well, but wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock failed to take the ball after spinner Dane Piedt had drawn the batsman from his crease and beaten the edge.South Africa earlier declared their second innings on 248 for five.Hashim Amla fell four short of a second century in the match when he uncharacteristically flashed wildly at a wide deliver from Stuart Broad in the pursuit of quick runs.Amla added 117 for the fifth wicket with Temba Bavuma (78 not out), who showed great application and maturity.The highest successful chase in test matches at Centurion Park is 251 by England in 2000, though the pitch was only used for two days in that match after rain spoiled the contest and the teams decided to forfeit an innings each to force a result.Thunderstorms are forecast in Pretoria on Tuesday, though those will likely come late in the afternoon.

"MELBOURNE -- A year after her finest Grand Slam to date, Madison Keys left this year's Australian Open in tears.Playing on an injured left leg, Keys fell to Zhang Shuai 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 in the fourth round in Melbourne.In the second set, Keys began hobbling noticeably and called for treatment. She was unable to engage in long rallies and grimaced between points.With speculation she might retire, No. 15 Keys returned to the court, but the pain only seemed to increase. Already down a break, Keys doubled-faulted two times in a row, handing her Chinese opponent the set.Keys limped to her changeover chair, understandably frustrated, but this time did not call a trainer.Somehow, she managed to go up an early break at 2-1 in the third on a crushing 91 mph forehand return but was immediately broken back.After a quick hold from Zhang, a qualifier, Keys took another medical timeout. In the next game, she was visibly crying in pain. At that point, Keys could hardly move, lunging at shots just out of her reach.Zhang, 27, ultimately pulled away, ending the match on an overcooked forehand from Keys. The American hobbled off the court, her face in a towel, distraught at the outcome.More than an hour after her three-set loss, Keys gingerly walked to an area adjacent to the women's locker room with the assistance of her publicist.Keys, too injured to make the longer jaunt to the main interview roof, expressed her disappointment.In her last round, Keys strained an abdominal muscle, an injury she said also bothered her against Zhang.Amazingly, the 133rd-ranked Zhang had never advanced past the first round of a major in 14 previous attempts.",1/25/2016,Keys falls to Zhang Shuai at Australian O,tennis,MELBOURNE,Madison;Madison Keys;Keys;Zhang;Shuai;Zhang Shuai,Zhang Shuai,
"MELBOURNE: Milos Raonic struck a blow for the next generation of mens tennis by flooring former champion Stan Wawrinka on Monday to reach the Australian Open quarter-finals.Second seed Andy Murray, returning to court two days after his father-in-law was rushed to hospital, hit back for the old guard in the evening session at Rod Laver Arena though, banishing Bernard Tomic, the last home hope in the singles.Murrays win capped a banner day for Britain following Johanna Kontas advance, giving the nation mens and womens singles quarter-finalists at the same grand slam for the first time in nearly 40 years.Melbourne Park was rocked by corruption allegations on its opening day, and a week later, integrity fears returned as a former Australian professional player pleaded guilty to match-fixing at a Sydney court.Former world number 187 Nick Lindahl appeared in court just hours after a top global bookmaker suspended betting after heavy gambling on a mixed doubles match at Melbourne Park.The winning doubles pair dismissed suspicions over the match after being questioned by integrity officials. There was no questioning the commitment of Raonic and Wawrinka as the pair slugged out a three-hour 44-minute thriller in the day session on Rod Laver Arena.Long seen as a threat to the Novak Djokovic-led establishment, 25-year-old Raonic showed ice in his veins to fend off the 2014 champion 6-4 6-3 5-7 4-6 6-3 after the 30-year-old Swiss roared back from two sets down.Unveiling an aggressive serve-volley game, Raonic fired 82 winners past the fourth seed to set up a second successive quarter-final at Melbourne Park.Having lost to Djokovic a year ago, he will be favourite against French showman Gael Monfils who delighted fans with some spectacular dives as he beat Russian Andrey Kuznetsov 7-5 3-6 6-3 7-6(4) to reach the quarter-finals for the first time.Raonic is on an eight-match winning streak since the start of the year, a run which included upsetting Roger Federer to win the Brisbane International, and he credits new coach Carlos Moya for giving him confidence to stray from the baseline.""Hes sort of organising my strengths, my weapons and how to use them better,"" the 13th seed told reporters.

"MELBOURNE: Second seed Andy Murray had his feathers ruffled but scrapped his way into the Australian Open quarter-finals with a 6-4 6-4 7-6(4) victory over local hope Bernard Tomic on Monday.The Briton, four-times a runner-up at Melbourne Park, was close to exasperation after being broken four times by the unorthodox Australian world number 17 but dug deep when it mattered to reach the last eight for the seventh year in a row.Murray had endured a tricky couple of days since Nigel Sears, the father of his pregnant wife Kim, collapsed in the stands on Rod Laver Arena and was taken to hospital while the Scot was playing his third round tie on Margaret Court Arena.As Sears, the coach of Ana Ivanovic, has since been discharged and cleared to join his daughter in England, Murray hoped he would have a calmer preparation for his quarter-final encounter with Spanish eighth seed David Ferrer.Murray, 28, enjoyed success with the drop shot early in the match but that started to wane in a match that was always interesting if never turning into a real contest.Tomic, 23, showed flashes of the quality that has had Australia raving about his potential since his early teens but was unable to maintain the level of his performance for sufficiently long periods to cause an upset.Murray, who fired 18 aces and 43 winners, clinched a topsy turvy third set in the tiebreak when Tomic went long with a return after two and a half hours on court.""I just felt I was very uncomfortable,"" Tomic, who dropped serve three times in the first set, said.""While on paper it looked like a close match it was uncomfortable for me.<br/> I didnt play the game the way I wanted to but he didnt let me.""After Johanna Konta earlier earned her place in the quarter-finals, Murrays victory means Britain will have a presence in the last eight of both draws of a grand slam for the first time since the 1977 Australian Open.Murray has his eye firmly fixed on becoming Britains first mens champion in Australia since Fred Perry in 1934 but he must get past Ferrer to do it.

"PRETORIA: A patient century stand between Hashim Amla and Temba Bavuma put South Africa in a commanding position at 223 for four at tea on day four of the final Test against England on Monday.Amla, a regular thorn in Englands side, was not out on 96 as he chases a second century in the match with Bavuma unbeaten on 63. The hosts led by 356 runs on a pitch that has turn, movement and uneven bounce.The pair have put on 117 for the fifth wicket and kept England wicketless between lunch and tea after the touring side had made good inroads in the opening session when a fired-up James Anderson grabbed two early wickets and Ben Stokes another.South Africa, who are likely to be down to three front-line bowlers in the second innings with seamer Kyle Abbott struggling due to a hamstring problem, must decide what target they want to set England with four sessions remaining.They will be mindful of overworking their depleted attack as they chase a consolation victory in the test with England already having claimed the series.The previous highest chase successful in Test matches at Centurion Park was 251 by England in 2000, though the pitch was only used for two days in that match after rain spoiled the contest and the teams decided to forfeit an innings each to force a result.Anderson had earlier taken his number of test wickets to 433, one short of Indian great Kapil Dev in sixth place on the all-time list.He first induced a rash drive from opener Stephen Cook (25) that provided a catch for wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow and two balls later grabbed the big scalp of home captain AB de Villiers, lbw without scoring.It was the third duck in a row for De Villiers, comfortably his worst run of form in Test cricket since he made his debut in 2004.Stokes removed JP Duminy (29) caught behind by Bairstow to leave South Africa sweating at 106 for four, before Amla and Bavuma edged the home side ahead again.

"PRETORIA: Englands nemesis Hashim Amla overcame a battered thumb and a lively wicket to post 50 not out and guide South Africa to 121 for four at lunch on day four of the final Test on Monday.The Proteas led by 254 runs on a rapidly deteriorating wicket with Amla and Temba Bavuma (nine not out) seeking to set England a record-breaking target if they are to win the series 3-0.The touring side bowled well in the morning session, with James Anderson grabbing two early wickets and Ben Stokes another.They have yet to dismiss Amla, though, as he showed great patience and steel while in obvious discomfort after being wrapped on the glove by Stokes on day three.He took his series runs tally to 424 at an average of 70.66 and remains the key in the Proteas posting a fourth-innings target they will feel is beyond England.Anderson had earlier taken his number of Test wickets to 433, one short of Indian great Kapil Dev in sixth place on the all-time list.He first induced a rash drive from opener Stephen Cook (25) that provided a catch for wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow and two balls later grabbed the big scalp of home captain AB de Villiers, lbw for a duck.It would have been a satisfying moment for Anderson after De Villiers had suggested before the game that Englands bowlers had lost pace, with many suggesting he was alluding specifically to Anderson.It was also the third duck in a row for De Villiers, comfortably his worst run of form in test cricket since he made his debut in 2004.South Africa still have first-innings centurion Quinton de Kock to bat before England are in to the tail, but chasing anything over 300 on a wicket with variable bounce and movement will be extremely difficult.It would also be a record, the previous highest chase in test matches on this ground was 251 by England in 2000, though the pitch was only used for two days in that match after rain spoiled the test and the teams decided to forfeit an innings each to force a result.

When I'm forced to play better, I do well.""The gulf between Williams and Sharapova, a former number one and five-times grand slam champion, speaks volumes about the balance of power in the women's game.Williams has reached the last four at Melbourne Park on six previous occasions and gone on to win the title every time.On Tuesday's evidence, it looks like only illness or injury can prevent the 34-year-old from repeating the feat and adding a 22nd major title to her collection.The American, who came into the tournament after a four-month layoff, twice had treatment for ""food poisoning issues"" during breaks in the 92-minute rematch of last year's final.Sharapova handed back her early break with two double faults in game four but started the match well and offered a genuine test in the 55-minute opening stanza.The Russian showed character to storm back from 0-40 down to hold serve for 4-4 and was all over Williams's serve in the next game, the American yelling ""C'mon!"" on successive points as she finally held.The match turned on the next game when Sharapova fended off three set points despite failing to get her first serve in before Williams converted the fourth after a long rally with a volley at the net.Sharapova had fired 21 aces in her fourth round match but managed just seven against Williams.""I think if you're serving maybe 180 (kph) against somebody else compared to Serena, that's an ace,"" said the 28-year-old.""Against Serena, as we all know, the return is one of her great strengths. She's very explosive. She stays quite close to the baseline.""She cuts the ball early. She doesn't give you many angles.""Williams has an 8-0 record against her semi-final opponent Agnieszka Radwanska, who as the fourth seed is the highest ranked challenger remaining in the draw.""Nothing's guaranteed in sports,"" said Williams.

"MELBOURNE: Johanna Konta ground down Chinese qualifier Zhang Shuai 6-4 6-1 at the Australian Open on Wednesday to become the first British woman to reach the semi-finals of a grand slam in over 30 years.Hours later, Andy Murray capped a banner day for Britain as he reached the semi-finals of the mens tournament with a four-set victory over David Ferrer.Murrays win ensured Britain have two representatives in the last four of a grand slam for the first time since 1977.The 47th-ranked Konta will seek to continue her fairytale run on Thursday when she meets German seventh seed Angelique Kerber for a place in the title-decider.Kontas rise has been little short of extraordinary, with her last trip to Melbourne Park cut short with a humbling exit at qualifying when ranked 147th in the world.Twelve months on, the Sydney-born 24-year-old has emulated Eugenie Bouchards breathtaking run at the 2014 tournament by reaching the last four on her main draw debut at Melbourne Park.The last British woman to make a grand slam semi-final was Jo Durie at the 1983 U.S.Open, while the last finalist was the 1977 Wimbledon champion Virginia Wade.Konta will bid to become the first British woman to reach the Australian Open final since Wades run to the 1972 title.Although Konta has reached lofty heights for British tennis, the quarter-final against Zhang failed to soar quite so high.Both players battled nerves and the Chinese qualifier came into the match fatigued after playing seven straight matches.Konta steadied first and rushed to a 5-2 lead before an attack of nerves nearly brought her undone.The Eastbourne resident crumbled with two double-faults when serving for the set and allowed Zhang to claw back to 5-4.As the first woman qualifier to reach the quarter-finals at Melbourne Park in nearly three decades, Zhang was never going to concede lightly.She saved five set points in an epic game before Konta ended the argument with a pair of booming first serves.The pair traded service breaks early in the second set before Konta roared to a 5-1 lead.Although struggling to muster the energy, Zhang battled to the end, saving two match points.But she was powerless to save the third when Konta hammered a shot into an obliging net-cord that gave the Chinese no chance.

"MELBOURNE: Serena Williams underlined the difference in class and power between her and the rest of the women's field with a 6-0 6-4 demolition of fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska on Thursday to reach her seventh Australian Open final.Every time the American has made the final at Melbourne Park she has gone on to win the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup.Victory in Saturday's final against either seventh seed Angelique Kerber or unseeded Briton Johanna Konta, would give her a 22nd grand slam title, moving her to a tie with Steffi Graf for the most in the Open era.Williams romped through the first set in just 20 minutes before Radwanska showed some fight in the second but she was unable to stop the momentum of the American, who clinched her place in the final in 64 minutes.""I'm really excited to be in another final. It blows my mind right now,"" Williams said in a courtside interview. ""I just feel like I'm being the best I can and I can't believe I'm in another final.""She started really well in the second set and making some great shots and hitting it deep and I just thought that I had to be aggressive.""Williams began in ominous fashion breaking the Pole's serve in the first game with Radwanska's lack of power highlighted by the blistering nature of the American's returns.Radwanska's fastest serve in the first game reached just 140 kph. Williams was returning the ball at over 130.The fourth seed appeared resigned to defeat in the first set by the fourth game. She barely got a backhand return to a Williams serve then stood, with slumping shoulders, and watched as the 34-year-old put the overhead smash away.Williams cleaned up the first set in just 20 minutes before Radwanska elicited the largest cheer of the match at that time when she held serve in the first game of the second set, avoiding an embarrassing potential 'double bagel' 6-0 6-0 score.The crowd on Rod Laver Arena, which had its roof closed due to heavy rain in Melbourne, however managed to almost open it in the sixth game with a decibel-rising roar of support for Radwanska when she broke Williams to level it at 3-3.Williams, however, broke again in the ninth game and then served out with three aces to seal a match in which she belted 42 winners to Radwanska's four.Radwanska, who had been bidding to reach her second grand slam final after Wimbledon in 2012, also heavily lost her only other semi-final appearance at Melbourne Park when she was beaten 6-1 6-2 by Dominika Cibulkova in 2014.",1/28/2016,Serena demolishes Radwanska to make final in Australi,tennis,MELBOURNE,Johanna Konta;Konta;Dominika;Steffi;Graf;Radwanska;Williams;Kerber;Agnieszka;Angelique;Johanna;Serena Williams;Dominika Cibulkova;Cibulkova;Angelique Kerber;Steffi Graf;Agnieszka Radwanska;Serena,Radwanska;Serena;Agnieszka Radwanska;Serena Williams,Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup.Victory

"MELBOURNE: Andy Murray went through paroxysms of frustration but seized another opportunity to break his Australian Open jinx with a four-hour, five-set semi-final victory over Milos Raonic on Friday.Four times the British world number two has advanced to the final at Melbourne Park and four times he has been vanquished, three times at the hands of Novak Djokovic.The Serbian will again stand in his path on Sunday as the Scot seeks to add another grand slam title to his 2012 U.S. Open and 2013 Wimbledon crowns.Raonic, meanwhile, was left heartbroken after suffering a thigh injury that hampered him from the middle of the third set of the 4-6 7-5 6-7(4) 6-4 6-2 defeat.Winning tennis matches never looks like a walk in the park for Murray but for much of the contest against the Canadian, he at least had some justification for the tortured grimaces and explosions of anger that followed every setback.The 13th seed has been on fire this year and his big serve and huge forehands had one of the best returners in the game on the ropes, while his new-found net game helped him to a healthy 72 winners.Murray said earlier this week that he would waste no more energy on the histrionics but the match was just minutes old when he returned to his chair muttering curses having been broken to love in his first service game.That was to be Raonics only break of the match but it was enough to win the first set and, after Murray had pounced to even up the contest, he ramped up his 230 kilometre-per-hour serve to clinch the third on tiebreak.The 25-year-old Raonic, hoping to become the first Canadian man to reach a grand slam final, was feeling the injury in the fourth set but Murray had also crucially got a better fix on his serve and broke for 4-3.Raonic almost claimed it back in the next game but Murray saved two break points, falling to one knee and roaring ""Yes! Yes!"" as he pumped his fist at the ground.Murray served out the set to even up the contest again and grabbed two breaks early in the decider as the wincing Raonics level dropped, the Canadians racket feeling the brunt of his frustration after the first.Murray finished off his ailing opponent with a sublime crosscourt backhand volley to bring up a match point, which he converted with a handsome forehand winner.The 28-year-old pointed both index fingers at the roof of Rod Laver Arena before slumping into his courtside chair with a look of relief on his face.The relief will not be long-lived, however, as he will be back on the same court on Sunday attempting to dethrone five-times champion Djokovic.Murrays older brother Jamie will be bidding for silverware on Saturday when he teams up with Bruno Soares to take on Daniel Nestor and Radek Stepanek in the mens doubles final.It is the first time two brothers have reached separate finals at the same grand slam.<br/> ""Youre not going to see it very often,"" Murray junior said.

"GUATEMALA CITY: Nearly $1 million in funds from soccer's global governing body FIFA may have gone missing from Guatemala's soccer federation last year, according to sources and an internal audit seen by Reuters.Dozens of soccer officials worldwide have been charged by U.S. authorities probing corruption in FIFA, in an investigation that has sent shockwaves across the sport.In 2015, the Guatemalan soccer federation (Fedefut) received 8.24 million quetzals ($1.1 mln) in nine deposits from FIFA from February to October, according to a document signed by the federation's accountant and seen by Reuters.The Fedefut budget presented early last year totaled about $1.5 million but only included about $250,000 in FIFA funding while the remaining funds from the nine deposits were not included, according to sources knowledgeable about the internal audit.The internal audit was conducted by a FIFA committee put in charge of running the Guatemalan soccer federation following the arrest on corruption charges last month of top local officials, and earlier on Friday the committee filed a complaint over the missing funds with the attorney general's office of the Central American country.The federation's year-end spending report excluded the additional deposits.The membership of Fedefut's general assembly was also not informed of the nine deposits.""That information was hidden,"" said one of the sources, adding that the results of an investigation into the missing funds will be provided to a visiting FIFA official next week.In one document, Fedefut's top budget official Oswaldo Rolando confirmed that the federation's financial division was informed of the extra deposits.""I don't know why they weren't made available to the general assembly,"" Rolando said in the documents.Ciro Muralles, the former head of the financial division, said in a brief phone interview that he would not comment on the missing funds until he reviews the documents.A spokesperson for the FIFA committee running Guatemala's soccer federation confirmed that the complaint seeks an investigation into ""the crimes that might have occurred.""Earlier this month, Guatemalan police arrested fugitive former Fedefut president Brayan Jimenez in connection with the corruption probe.Jimenez has been accused of taking bribes along with Hector Trujillo, former secretary general of the Guatemalan soccer federation, who was arrested last month in the United States.Both have denied the charges.",1/30/2016,Nearly 1 mn in FIFA funds missing in Gu,football,GUATEMALA,Brayan;Oswaldo Rolando;Jimenez;Brayan Jimenez;Hector Trujillo;Hector;Oswaldo;Trujillo;Rolando,,Reuters.The Fedefut;Fedefut;FIFA
"SYDNEY: Shane Watsons unbeaten hundred could not prevent Australia falling to a seven-wicket defeat to India in the third and final Twenty20 match on Sunday as Suresh Raina hit a four on the last ball to complete a 3-0 clean sweep in the series.India were chasing 198 to win and needed 17 runs in the final over as Yuvraj Singh hit a four and a six off the first two balls from paceman Andrew Tye and Raina hit the final ball through point with his team needing two.All-rounder Watson, leading Australia in the absence of the injured Aaron Finch, powered the hosts to 197-5 with an unbeaten 124 after winning the toss and opting to bat.Australia made five changes to the side that lost the last match in Melbourne to concede an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series, handing debuts to batsman Usman Khawaja and part-time wicketkeeper Cameron Bancroft.Watson, named player of the match, was the fulcrum around which the hosts batting revolved and it was due to his 71-ball knock, which was studded with 10 fours and six sixes, that Australia posted a strong total.India replied with half-centuries from in-form opener Rohit Sharma (52) and Virat Kohli (50), who was named the player of the series, and then Rainas 25-ball 49 to chase down the steep target.Rohit and Shikhar Dhawan got India off to a rollicking start, scoring 46 in just 3.2 overs, with fast bowler Shaun Tait going for 24 runs in the third over.Rohit and Kohli then added 78 for the second wicket to keep India strongly on course, before both batsmen fell to leg spinner Cameron Boyce.Yuvraj, who did not get an opportunity to bat in the last two matches, was sent in ahead of captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni at number five and though the left-hander struggled initially to put bat on ball, he produced the goods when his team needed.Raina and Yuvraj added 53 for the unbroken fourth wicket.The 3-0 sweep in Australia took India to the top of the T20 rankings in a timely boost ahead of the World Twenty20 at home from March 8-April 3.

"AUCKLAND: Martin Guptill and Kane Williamson hit brisk fifties and combined in a record stand of 159 to power New Zealand to a thrilling series-clinching three-wicket win against Pakistan in the third and final one-day international in Auckland on Sunday.Babar Azam (83) and Mohammad Hafeez (76) laid the platform for a big total with a stand of 134 for the third wicket after Pakistan won the toss and opted to bat.But the touring side, needing to win the match to tie the series at 1-1, suffered a mid-innings collapse to be shot out for 290 in the 48th over.Brendon McCullum, returning from a back injury to lead the side, fell on the first delivery he faced from Mohammad Amir but Guptill (82) and Williamson (84) steadied the chase with their stand, the highest for the second wicket for the hosts.Pakistan captain Azhar Ali dismissed both batsmen in quick succession with his part-time leg spin to bring his side back into the match and New Zealand were quickly reduced to 210-5.But a rain interruption disrupted play and when New Zealand returned their target had been revised to 263 off 43 overs by the Duckworth-Lewis method.All-rounder Corey Anderson (35) was given not out by umpire Billy Bowden off Rahat Ali after a confident appeal for caught behind and the powerful left-hander made most of his fortune by smashing the paceman for two sixes on the next two balls.New Zealand, needing six to win off the last over, got over the mark with two balls to spare with Mitchell Santner hitting Wahab Riaz for two boundaries.Earlier, Pakistan were comfortably placed on 215-3 in the 31st over, riding on half-centuries from Hafeez and Azam but lost their remaining seven wickets for just 75 runs to fall short of the target they would have liked to set New Zealand.They would have folded for even less had wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed not scored 41.Adam Milne accounted for Pakistans tail, picking up 3-49 while Trent Boult and Matt Henry picked up two wickets each.",1/31/2016,Kiwis beat Pakistan to bag series 2 0,cricket,AUCKLAND,Sarfraz Ahmed;Mohammad Hafeez;Santner;Milne;Kane Williamson;Billy Bowden;Corey Anderson;Kane;Wahab Riaz;Bowden;Matt;Williamson;Mitchell;Trent;Trent Boult;Azam;McCullum;Rahat;Henry;Billy;Ahmed;Mohammad Amir;Boult;Wahab;Sarfraz;Martin;Amir;Azhar;Azhar Ali;Anderson;Matt Henry;Mohammad;Hafeez;Adam;Mitchell Santner;Martin Guptill;Guptill;Adam Milne;Riaz;Rahat Ali;Corey;Ali,,

"DHAKA: Hasan Mohsin starred with bat and ball as Pakistan Under-19s defended 212 to beat Sri Lanka Under-19s by 23 runs and finish top of Group B. Pakistan will take on West Indies in the quarter-finals while Sri Lanka will meet England.Sent in to bat, Pakistan made slow progress at first, and their run rate was still below four an over when Wanidu Hasaranga dismissed Salman Fayyaz (33) in the 41st over to end his 61-run stand with Mohsin.Wickets fell steadily at the other end, with none of bottom five getting into double figures, but Mohsin ensured he dragged Pakistan to a competitive total, and was ninth out for a run-a-ball 86 with eight fours and a six. Pakistan were bowled out for 212 in the 49th over.Opening the bowling with his gentle seam-up, Mohsin then gave Pakistan two early breakthroughs, dismissing both Sri Lankan openers.

"WELLINGTON: Mitchell Marsh kept calm after New Zealand got the sniff of an unlikely victory and scored his sixth one-day international half century to guide Australia to a four-wicket win in the second match of their one-day series on Saturday.The victory levelled the three-match series at 1-1 with the final game in Hamilton on Monday.Australia have not lost a bilateral one-day series since India in October, 2013.Marsh scored an unbeaten 69 and combined with John Hastings (48 not out) in an unbroken 86-run seventh-wicket partnership for the visitors as they overhauled New Zealands 281 for nine with 3.3 overs remaining.David Warner top scored with 98 in Australias 283-6, and combined with the recalled Usman Khawaja (50) in a 122-run opening stand that had set the foundation for their victory.Mitchell Santner had almost taken the game away from the visitors with his left-arm spin, breaking the opening partnership and then trapping Warner leg before when the aggressive opener was within sight of his sixth one-day century.Santner then had Matthew Wade brilliantly caught in the deep by Adam Milne for two to reduce the visitors to 197 for six in the 33rd over and give the hosts a sniff of victory in a game they had not played well enough to win.Too many overs were peppered with boundary balls as they struggled with their length on a wicket that had little help for the bowlers.They had also not posted a big enough target as their innings suffered from fits and starts with all of the batsmen, apart from Henry Nicholls, laying solid foundations only to fall when they needed to build.Kane Williamson top-scored with 60, though the hosts total was only pushed to a score considered defendable courtesy of a 61-run eighth-wicket stand between Santner (45 not out) and Milne (36).The 24-year-old Santner, who only made his international debut last year, is quickly impressing as an automatic selection in all formats of the game with his fluid batting and handy left-arm spin. (Reuters) -Saturdays match showcased his blossoming capabilities, with New Zealand slumping to 193 for six in the 37th over and in danger of being bowled out before their full allocation.Santner, who was joined by the right-handed Milne 12 runs later, however kept the strike ticking over to put the bowlers off their rhythm, turned singles into twos with hard running and hit the bad ball to the boundary.Opening bowler Josh Hazlewood, however, ended the partnership, and stopped New Zealand from edging closer to a more competitive 300, to finish with 3-61 from 10 overs.",02-06-2016,Marsh guides Australia to series levelling win in NZ,cricket,WELLINGTON,Wade;Nicholls;Mitchell Marsh;John;Usman Khawaja;Santner;Matthew Wade;Milne;Williamson;Mitchell;Josh;Henry;Henry Nicholls;Hastings;Josh Hazlewood;John Hastings;Adam;Adam Milne;Matthew;Marsh;Khawaja;Hazlewood;Usman,,Warner;Australias;Reuters
"WELLINGTON: New Zealand tallied 281 for 9 in Wellington despite a much improved Australian bowling and fielding effort in a match the visitors must win to keep the Chappell-Hadlee series alive.Kane Williamson made a smooth 60 but it was a late-innings partnership of 61 from 44 balls between Mitchell Santner and Adam Milne that added heft to the innings after the Australians had claimed regular wickets throughout the afternoon.Legspinner Adam Zampa bowled well in his first international match to claim the wickets of Williamson and Grant Elliott, while John Hastings, Josh Hazlewood, Scott Boland and Mitchell Marsh also put in decent shifts with the ball.Nevertheless, Australia must perform far more staunchly with the bat than they managed in the series opener at Eden Park if they wish to force a decider at Seddon Park in Hamilton in two days' time. Usman Khawaja, among others, will be eager to make a difference.Australia made three changes to the team that was given a hiding in Auckland, dropping Shaun Marsh for Khawaja, while Boland came in for Kane Richardson due to back soreness, and the debutant Zampa was called up in place of the injured James Faulkner. Zampa had his ODI cap presented to him by Allan Border.New Zealand, by contrast, were unchanged, in a match where they can complete a series victory over Australia for the first time since 2007. Their captain Brendon McCullum led a typically hyperactive start to proceedings, clattering 28 from 12 balls including a six off each of the Australia pacemen.Boland's very first ball was sent flying back over his head and into the sight screen, but he responded well by pulling back his length and being rewarded when McCullum charged again and was bowled. That wicket scotched much of the early momentum, even if Martin Guptill and Williamson moved along smoothly enough for the next 11 overs.It was Mitchell Marsh who broke the stand, prompting a miscue from Guptill when he tried to force the pace a little more. The chance swirled out towards deep cover, where Khawaja showed excellent judgment to claim a catch more difficult than it appeared. Marsh had another victim when Henry Nicholls, called up to the Test team this week, wafted at a wide delivery. New Zealand had stalled.Williamson and Elliott formed another useful stand without ever looking in total command. This was in part due to the thoughtful work of Zampa, who varied his pace artfully to keep the batsmen guessing. His reward would come in consecutive overs, as first Williamson then Elliott pushed catches to cover as they tried to manufacture boundaries.That put New Zealand five down, and regular wickets from there prevented the hosts from pulling together a total of the dimensions they managed at Eden Park. Santner and Milne pulled back some of the ground in the closing overs, but the tourists could be happier with their effort.",02-06-2016,New Zealand set 282 for Australia in second ODI,cricket,WELLINGTON,Mitchell Marsh;Santner;John;Milne;Kane;Faulkner;Shaun Marsh;Henry Nicholls;Allan;Brendon;John Hastings;Adam;Adam Zampa;Zealand;Brendon McCullum;Guptill;Boland;James Faulkner;Hazlewood;Allan Border.New Zealand;Usman;Nicholls;Usman Khawaja;Grant Elliott;Williamson;Kane Richardson;Zampa;Mitchell;Elliott;Border.New;Josh;McCullum;Henry;Grant;James;Shaun;Hastings;Martin;Josh Hazlewood;Mitchell Santner;Richardson;Martin Guptill;Adam Milne;Marsh;Scott Boland;Khawaja;Scott,,

"DUBAI: A skilful performance from the left-arm duo of Mohammad Asghar and Wahab Riaz sealed Peshawar Zalmi's 24-run win in their opening fixture against Islamad United.Defending 145, Asghar's slow, loopy spinners derailed Islamabad's top order. He dismissed Babar Azam for a duck in his first over, Umar Amin for four in his second and then got the big wicket of Misbah-ul-Haq for 12 as Islamabad lost half their side for 66 runs. Shane Watson, who made 28, was their top-scorer, but he was dismissed by Wahab in the ninth over.Sam Billings and Andre Russell resisted, but both of them fell off successive balls and Wahab finished with 3 for 32. Asghar had a hand in those wickets too - he clung on to two sharp chances on the cover boundary and later played them down by saying he had large hands like most Pathans and so it would be hard to drop catches. So United fell to 121 for 9 and their second defeat in as many matches.In the first innings, Peshawar managed to reach 145 with Tamim Iqbal making a run-a-ball half-century. It ended up a crucial contribution considering Peshawar, having chosen to bat, had stumbled to 88 for 4 in the 15th over and needed a set batsman in the middle for Shahid Afridi and Darren Sammy to go hard at the other end. Their late hitting pushed the total past 140 in the death, though, none of Peshawar's batsmen, barring Tamim, managed a score more than 16.

"Brendon McCullum's final one-day international innings ended as spectacularly as it began when the New Zealand captain was dismissed for 47 in the series finale against Australia in Hamilton on Monday.McCullum, who had hit six fours and three sixes in his 27-ball innings, was well caught by John Hastings at mid-off after charging down the wicket at fast bowling all rounder Mitchell Marsh only to miscue the shot.The 34-year-old was given a standing ovation at the sold out Seddon Park as he walked off and he gave heir apparent Kane Williamson a fist bump in a symbolic passing of the baton.McCullum will retire from all internationals after the second test against Steve Smith's side in Christchurch and he has been greeted by enthusiastic crowds throughout the one-day series, lauding his contribution to the game.On Monday McCullum battled to suppress his emotions during the coin toss, which he unsurprisingly lost, and was greeted by a guard of honour by the Australians with Smith shaking his hand.After being initially cautious, his first four scoring shots were boundaries.His first six, off Scott Boland, was a beautifully timed shot over long off. He hit Boland for two more sixes in the right armer's next over with the second dispatched over mid-wicket to bring up his 200th one-day international six.He is just the fourth player to hit 200 one-day sixes but the only one to have 100 in test cricket as well.He hit his sixth boundary off Mitchell Marshall in the 10th over when he guided the ball to the vacant third man boundary but was dismissed on the next ball with New Zealand 84-1",02-08-2016,Brendon McCullum dismissed for 47 in final one day inning,cricket,,Mitchell Marsh;Smith;John;Hastings;Kane Williamson;Marshall;John Hastings;Kane;Mitchell Marshall;Williamson;Steve;Mitchell;Boland;Marsh;Steve Smith;McCullum;Scott Boland;Scott,Brendon McCullum,

"CENTURION: Joe Roots highest ODI score has left South Africa requiring a record chase if they are to avoid conceding a series-deciding defeat at the hands of England.Root's 125, the highest ODI score made by an England batsman against South Africa, has left the hosts needing to make the highest successful chase in an ODI at Centurion. West Indies' 300 for three, scored in 2004, is the record to date.In these days of great expectations of ODI scores, England's total of 318 for eight may not seem particularly extravagant. But on a cracked, two-paced pitch that challenges batsmen with uneven bounce, it is likely to prove a challenging target.South Africa lost the first two ODIs of the five-match series and are in danger of conceding defeat in the Test and ODI series to the same opposition during a home tour for the first time in 14 years.By the time South Africa struck for the fourth time, they could have been quietly satisfied with their work. Jos Buttler, again promoted to No. 4 to build upon the strong start from England's top order, had fallen first ball clipping to an intriguingly placed leg gully, while Eoin Morgan had laboured for 24 deliveries over his eight runs.But then Ben Stokes joined Root in a fifth-wicket stand of 82 in eight overs that took England's total from the average to the strong.",02-09-2016,Root ton helps England reach 318 8,cricket,CENTURION,Ben Stokes;Morgan;Stokes;Jos Buttler;Eoin Morgan;Ben;Buttler;Eoin;Jos,,

"KINGSTON: West Indies players will be thrown off the squad for the World Twenty20 if they do not agree to financial terms by Sundays deadline, the head of the regions cricket board said on Tuesday.The hard-line stance comes in the wake of reports that the 15-man squad, upset at a huge pay cut, has rejected the contract offered by West Indies Cricket Board (WICB).Cricinfo.com on Tuesday published a letter from Darren Sammy to the WICB in which the West Indies captain said the financial terms for the World Twenty20, which starts in India on March 8, were unacceptable.""We want to represent the West Indies but the financials on offer we cant accept,"" Sammy wrote.WICB chief executive Michael Muirhead did not sound in a negotiating mood, however, when he spoke on Jamaican radio.""The WICB is committed to play in the tournament, let me say that first,"" Muirhead said on Hitz 92fm.""No one will leave the shores of the West Indies without signing a contract and if these players in particular choose not to sign, then I guess well be left with no option but to substitute other players for them.""Muirhead added that the board was not in a position to improve the renumeration package, negotiated with the players association nine months ago.""They have had lots of time to digest and argue and do everything,"" he said.""Five of the players were instrumental and were there at the onset, so at this point, Im hoping that the players will sign and take advantage of the other benefits that are there.""He said that players would receive half of any shirt sponsorship the board negotiates in addition to a portion of prize money.Although West Indies cricket has fallen on hard times in the test format, it remains a major player in the shortest form of the game.West Indies won the 2012 World Twenty20 in Sri Lanka and are currently ranked second in the world.This years squad includes dashing batsmen Chris Gayle and Kieron Pollard.Sammy, who requested an urgent meeting before Sundays deadline, has proposed the players participate in the World Twenty20 under the same conditions as at previous tournaments.He said players were facing a pay cut of nearly 80 percent and stood to earn only $21,000 apiece this year, compared to $135,000 at the last tournament.The latest impasse between WICB and the players comes some 18 months after the premature end of West Indies tour of India because of a longstanding payment dispute.",02-10-2016,Windies board rejects call for new deal in World T20 r,cricket,KINGSTON,Pollard.Sammy;Michael Muirhead;Hitz;wrote.WICB;Muirhead;Kieron Pollard.Sammy;Chris Gayle;Gayle;Darren;Sammy;Darren Sammy;Chris;Michael;Kieron;Sammy wrote.WICB,,West Indies Cricket Board;WICB

"WELLINGTON:><strong>Swing and seam friendly conditions, a lack of truly scary Australian bowlers and New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum's retirement are all themes that will resonate when the first test gets underway in Wellington on Friday.</strongThe Basin Reserve wicket was heavily grassed just 48 hours out from the toss and, even if brilliant sunshine in New Zealand's capital was expected to brown it off, McCullum and Steve Smith are still likely to ask the opposition to bat.Similarly-grassed pitches in New Zealand in recent years have not helped the fast bowlers as much as expected, however, as both captains noted on Thursday.""I think the wicket will dry out quicker than what you'd expect,"" McCullum said. ""The first two days will be challenging for the batsmen ... (and) you have to just hang in there and get a competitive score.""It's not going to be the 500 or 600 but you just have to be competitive and then the third and fourth innings are where things take shape.""Despite having won 29 of their 55 previous tests against New Zealand and taken the home encounter 2-0 last November, Australia are not overwhelming favourites to win the series and reclaim the number one ranking in test cricket.Their pace bowling unit of Peter Siddle, Jackson Bird and new spearhead Josh Hazlewood lacks the blistering speed of the two Mitchells, Starc and Johnson, both of whom created doubt, and at times fear, in the minds of batsmen.Hazlewood's ability to swing the ball and Siddle's to seam it off the pitch should create issues for New Zealand but the Australians have shown they are not immune to struggles with similar movement.Last year at Trent Bridge, Stuart Broad showed how badly they play the moving ball when he took 8-15 as England skittled the tourists for 60 in their first innings.""We haven't been good enough with the bat on wickets that have been doing a bit in the last year or so,"" Smith said.""The wicket here looks like it might do a bit so we've got a bit to prove and we've got to adapt accordingly, a lot better than we have in recent times.""New Zealand's opening duo Tim Southee and Trent Boult have the ability to swing and seam the ball and while they have been down on pace this summer, recent outings have suggested they are pushing it back into the 140kph plus range.That pace will be needed to try and put pressure on an Australian side which is likely to retain the aggressive mindset that has characterised their batting in recent years.Underpinning the entire series is the fact McCullum will retire after the second test in Christchurch.The first match at the Basin Reserve will be his 100th test, all of which have been played in succession since his debut in 2004.""I'm looking forward to these two test matches,"" McCullum said.

"RANCHI: On a dry surface in a dusty Ranchi ground, India's top order moved into customary home form, and their bowlers exposed a fragile Sri Lanka top order. Shikhar Dhawan was bruiser-in-prime, unleashing an early shellacking that brought him 51, and set the team on course to a big total. They reached 196 for 6, thanks to helpful hands from the top five, which today included a pinch-hitting Hardik Pandva. That total was 69 too many for Sri Lanka.On a pitch with little pace and minimal seam movement, the pacers that had delivered Sri Lanka's Pune win, were expensive. Even Sri Lanka's first T20 international hat-trick - to Thisara Perera - barely made a difference, coming as it did in the penultimate over. Dinesh Chandimal will perhaps rue having chosen to bowl first.R Ashwin had troubled Sri Lanka's batsmen even on the Pune green top, and MS Dhoni savvily had him open the bowling here. Ashwin removed a returning Tillakaratne Dilshan second ball, and the chase never really recovered from that. Soon they were 3 for 16, Ashish Nehra claiming two early scalps. Chandimal and Chamara Kapugedara then embarked on a recovery that was far too slow to give the visitors any real chance of victory, and wickets tumbled late in the middle overs, as the required rate crept up through the teens. Ashwin finished with 3 for 14 from his four overs.Dhawan got to 50 off his 22nd delivery, but departed soon after, nicking a throat-high Dushmantha Chameera ball to the keeper. That wicket bought Sri Lanka brief respite. They bowled five overs for 30, before the runs began to flow again.Chameera claimed Rohit's scalp in the 14th over, with an athletic return catch, and Senanayake removed Rahane soon after, but India's final push began when Pandya arrived at the crease a few places higher than he would normally bat. After two sighters he began his assault.Raina added his own finishing blows to the closing surge, taking particular liking to Chameera, whose figures he ruined. Having sent down his first two overs for 10 runs, Chameera saw his third disappear for 18. His last also went for 10. In between Perera took a low-key hat-trick, having Pandya, Raina and Yuvraj Singh hole out to low full tosses. His figures were dramatically improved as a result. He finished with 3 for 33 from three overs.Dilshan was stumped over-reaching off the first ball he faced. Seekkuge Prasanna was sent up the order to provide some early impetus, but lacked the technique to deal with the new ball, and chewed up four balls for one run. Danushka Gunathilaka amplified Sri Lanka's problems at the top of the order with another poor score.Kapugedara and Chandimal's 49-ball fourth-wicket partnership yielded only 52 runs. By the time they had departed, off successive Jadeja deliveries in the 12th over, the required rate had climbed to more than 14.5, and the chase was kaput. Dasun Shanaka and Milinda Siriwardana struck some late sixes, doing good to at least their own batting confidence, if nothing much for the team cause.",02-12-2016,Dhawan bowlers power Indias series levelling wi,cricket,RANCHI,Jadeja;Hardik;Chandimal;Milinda Siriwardana;Siriwardana;Ashish;Prasanna;Nehra;Raina;Milinda;Danushka Gunathilaka;Rohit;Tillakaratne;Yuvraj;Seekkuge;Dhoni;Ashish Nehra;Hardik Pandva;Dinesh Chandimal;Kapugedara;Ashwin;Pandya;Rahane;Tillakaratne Dilshan;Dilshan;Singh;Dasun Shanaka;Chamara Kapugedara;Shikhar Dhawan;Gunathilaka;Dasun;Seekkuge Prasanna;Danushka;Senanayake;Chameera;Shanaka;Shikhar;Dinesh;Dhawan;Yuvraj Singh;Pandva;Chamara;Perera,Dhawan;Shikhar Dhawan,

"Stuart Broad returns to the England side for the first time since the 2015 World Cup.Broad was dropped from the white-ball sides after a disappointing tournament in Australia and New Zealand and also missed out on selection for England's World T20 squad, announced earlier this week.But he has never made any secret of his desire to return and has often stated his ambition to feature in the ICC Champions Trophy, in 2017, and the World Cup, in 2019. Both those events will be held in England.Broad enjoyed an excellent Test on this ground less than a month ago, where he claimed 6 for 17 in the second innings to help England secure the series.He may find conditions less helpful this time, though. There is a painfully short boundary on one side of the ground and the pitch appears to lack the cracks he exploited so well during the Test.Broad replaces David Willey in the side for this match, while Chris Woakes, who was also omitted from the World T20 squad, returns to the England side in place of Chris Jordan, who has taken one wicket in 17.3 overs in the series, at an average of 143 and an economy rate of 8.17. Both Jordan and Willey were named in the World T20 squad.South Africa also made a change, bringing in Chris Morris for Morne Morkel in an attempt to strengthen their batting. AB de Villiers has won the toss and inserted England, reasoning that conditions would favour the chasing team under lights, just as they did at Centurion earlier in the week.England, with a 2-1 lead going into this match, could wrap up the five-match series if they win today.South Africa 1 Hashim Amla, 2 Quinton de Kock (wk), 3 Faf du Plessis, 4 AB de Villiers (capt), 5 JP Duminy, 6 Farhaan Behardien, 7 David Wiese, 8 Kagiso Rabada, 9 Kyle Abbott, 10 Chris Morris, 11 Imran TahiEngland 1 Jason Roy, 2 Alex Hales, 3 Joe Root, 4 Eoin Morgan (capt), 5 Ben Stokes, 6 Jos Buttler (wk), 7 Moeen Ali, 8 Chris Woakes, 9 Adil Rashid, 10 Stuart Broad, 11 Reece Topley.",02-12-2016,Broad back as SA win toss and field in 4th ODI,cricket,,de;David Willey;Rashid;David Wiese;Chris;Morris;Jason;Buttler;Alex;Joe;Kyle;Root;Chris Morris;Adil Rashid;Farhaan;Joe Root;Moeen Ali;Farhaan Behardien;Jos;Abbott;Quinton;Stokes;Kyle Abbott;David;Adil;Behardien;Hashim;Roy;Moeen;Chris Jordan;Wiese;Reece Topley;Chris Woakes;Hales;Quinton de Kock;Willey;Eoin;Kock;Ben Stokes;Morgan;Morkel;Morne;Jordan;Amla;Hashim Amla;Jos Buttler;Reece;Ben;Topley;Woakes;Morne Morkel;Eoin Morgan;Jason Roy;Alex Hales;Ali,,Faf du Plessis;Stuart Broad;Africa;JP Duminy;Kagiso Rabada;AB de Villiers
"WELLINGTON: Steve Smith and Usman Khawaja hammered home the advantage their bowlers had established when they took Australia to 147-3, a deficit of just 36 runs, at the close of the opening days play in the first Test against New Zealand on Friday.Australia captain Smith, who won the toss and sent New Zealand in to bat on a green Basin Reserve pitch, shook off some recent poor form to reach 71 before he was caught and bowled by Mark Craig.Khawaja scored his fourth Test half century with 57 not out, while Adam Voges (seven not out) was bowled by Doug Bracewell in the final over of the day only to survive because of a contentious no ball. Television replays showed the delivery was clearly legal.The tourists had earlier dismissed New Zealand for 183, Josh Hazlewood and Peter Siddle reducing them to 51-5 in the 12th over and Nathan Lyon polishing off the tail after lunch.Hazlewood finished with 4-42, Siddle took 3-37, while off-spinner Lyon grabbed 3-32 and the tea break was taken 10 minutes early when Trent Boult was caught at long on for 24.Craig top-scored with 41 not out but the pitch appeared to have lost much of its bite by the end of New Zealands innings, which lasted 48 overs.Tim Southee, however, managed to get rid of both Joe Burns (0) and David Warner (5) to leave the visitors 5-2 in the third over and with the sell-out crowd in full voice.Southee and Boult kept up the pressure on Smith and Khawaja but when they scored 37 runs, from nine fours and a single, in 16 deliveries, the shackles were broken and crowd silenced.Smith was eventually dismissed about 20 minutes before stumps when he hit the ball back to Craig to end the 126-run partnership.The crowd began the day celebrating McCullums milestone as he became just the third New Zealander to earn 100 Test caps and the first man in world cricket to achieve them in succession from debut.Australia, however, seized control of the match shortly after Smith won the toss and simply bowled straight and waited for the ball to do just enough to catch the outside edge.New Zealands first seven wickets all fell to catches behind the stumps, but the last three, all Lyons victims, were caught in front from mis-timed attacking shots.

"WELLINGTON: Adam Voges continued to capitalise on an early reprieve by scoring his fifth Test century as Australia eased to 463 for six by the close of the second days play of the first match against New Zealand at the Basin Reserve on Saturday.Voges was unbeaten on 176 at stumps with Peter Siddle on 29 as the Australians stretched their advantage to 280 runs, snuffing out any hope New Zealand had of claiming victory in captain Brendon McCullums 100th Test.The 36-year-old Voges has made the most of a lifeline when he was bowled by Doug Bracewell for seven with two deliveries remaining on Friday, only for umpire Richard Illingworth to signal a no-ball.Television replays showed the delivery was legal but because the infraction had been called on the field, New Zealand were unable to ask for a review.Voges was involved in partnerships of 168 with Usman Khawaja (140) and 96 with wicketkeeper Peter Nevill (32) to prevent New Zealand from gaining any momentum on a tough day for the hosts.New Zealand briefly appeared to be in position to expose the Australian tail during the middle session when Trent Boult took two wickets, including Khawajas, in three deliveries but Voges calmly ensured that the visitors maintained their dominance.The late-blooming Voges, who was 35 when he made his debut against West Indies last June, has scored 1,204 runs in a bountiful Test career to date, boasting a high score of 269 not out and an average of 100.33.As Australia resumed on 147-3 in response to New Zealands 183 all out, the only excitement for locals at a sold-out Basin Reserve came during that eventful Boult over in the middle session.Corey Anderson claimed the only other wicket of the day when he enticed Nevill to edge behind to make the score 395-6.While Australia have batted themselves into a position they are unlikely to lose from, New Zealands past record at the Basin Reserve should provide local fans with some hope.In their last two matches at the Wellington ground, they conceded large first innings leads before scoring 680-8 to save a test against India two years ago and 524-5 to set up a win last year against Sri Lanka.The second Test of the two-match series is in Christchurch from Feb.20-24.

However, despite the defeat, other results in the tournament meant that Peshawar were through to the playoffs.Lahore, after being inserted, lost Chris Gayle for a first-ball duck, but Delport put up fifty-plus stands with Azhar Ali (25) and Umar Akmal to seize the advantage.Delport's partnership with Akmal for the third wicket yielded 101 runs; Delport hit six fours and three sixes for his 78, while Akmal's 31-ball 52 featured six fours. Their efforts ensured that Peshawar needed to chase at more than eight an over right from the off.Tamim Iqbal kept the runs flowing for Peshawar with a quick 30, but the team lost wickets in a cluster to soon fall to 95 for 4.Peshawar needed 70 runs from 46 balls at that time, but Malan blew new wind into his team's chase by blasting a 35-ball 42 with three sixes. His blows brought the equation down to 18 off the last two overs, but Malan was trapped lbw by Kevon Cooper off the first ball in the penultimate over, tilting the contest back Lahore's way.Peshawar needed 16 off the last over, and despite a six from Wahab Riaz, they could only muster 160 for 7.

"WELLINGTON: Australia secured an easy victory in the first Test against New Zealand on Monday, thrashing the hosts by an innings and 52 runs after lunch on the fourth day to take a 1-0 lead in the two-match series.Nathan Lyon grabbed two more wickets to finish with figures of 4-91 for Australia, who can take the top test ranking from India with a series victory.The second match starts in Christchurch on February 20.Mark Craig, who top scored in New Zealands first innings with 41 not out, was left 33 not out when Trent Boult was bowled by Mitchell Marsh for 12 to bring the hosts second innings to an end on 327.New Zealand were dismissed for 183 in their first innings and faced a deficit of 379 runs after Adam Voges second Test double century drove Australia to a mammoth 562.The visitors captured the last six wickets on Monday without the experienced Peter Siddle, who bowled just eight overs on Sunday before succumbing to a back spasm.Hazlewood trapped Doug Bracewell in front for 14 just three deliveries after they returned from the break.Tim Southee provided some typical rearguard fireworks with 48 from 23 balls but holed out at long on trying to hit a fourth six off Lyon, before Boult was bowled by Marsh just under an hour into the final session.The only bright spot for New Zealand was debutant Henry Nicholls scoring his first test half century before he was bowled by Bird for 59.Hazlewoods ability to get the older ball to reverse swing should be of concern for New Zealand, whose top-four batsmen made solid starts but failed to push on in what were considered good batting conditions.""We were outplayed throughout the test match and Australia deserve to be 1-0 up in the series,"" New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum said.""We need to be a bit better than what we were, though obviously Australia were very very good in this Test match.

"MELBOURNE:><strong>Australia all-rounder Shane Watson is confident he will be fit for the World Twenty20 in India despite an abdominal strain cutting short his campaign in the Pakistan Super League.</strongThe 34-year-old suffered the injury bowling for Islamabad in the T20 tournament in the United Arab Emirates and immediately withdrew to fly home to Sydney for scans and an assessment.Its going to take me a couple of weeks to get back into batting and bowling,"" Watson told The Australian newspaper, adding that the injury was ""not major"".""We got it before it did too much damage.Im very confident Ill be right for the World Cup.

"CAPE TOWN: South Africa recorded their first ever women's T20 victory over England to level the three-match series at 1-1. In a rain-interrupted innings, South Africa, anchored by Dane van Niekerk 's second successive fifty, held their nerve and paced their chase well to ensure Sunday's fixture will be a decider.After England defended 147 in Paarl a day ago, they would have thought they had enough when they crept over that total at Newlands. Sarah Taylor formed the spine of the innings, as she did in the first match, but she also had greater support. She shared in a 61-run second-wicket stand with Charlotte Edwards and a 63-run fourth-wicket partnership with Heather Knight but South Africa, helped by wayward bowling and clumsy fielding from England, were not overawed.Van Niekerk, who was dropped on 6 and 22, set the tone when she dispatched a loosener from Anya Shrubsole and then punished Danielle Hazell, who erred in length. She was almost run out, too, when Trisha Chetty sent her back even though she had advanced more than halfway down the wicket from the non-striker's end. The throw from Hazell came in at the striker's end instead but quick work from Taylor ensured Chetty was out.If van Niekerk was shaken by it, she did not show any signs and struck the first six of the innings with a slog sweep. She hit the ball with power and fine placement and beat short third man with a delicate lap to enter the 40s. Her fifty came via a pull off the 34th ball she faced. That shot also took South Africa halfway to the target.They were well placed on 80 for 1 after 10 overs and England could not pull them back. Jenny Gunn was punished for width but, just as South Africa seemed to get away, Rebecca Grundy struck. She beat van Niekerk, who had come down the track, and Taylor whipped the bails off.The first rains fell at the end of that over but South Africa, at 108 for 2, were well ahead on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern and Marizanne Kapp had already showed her intent to finish things off fast with two furious pulls.The delay was short and Mignon du Preez and Kapp kept South Africa above the required rate, so that when the second interruption happened, four over and two balls later, South Africa were still ahead despite Kapp's dismissal. More rain followed and the players did not get back on but South Africa's batsmen had earned their first win over England after 14 attempts.",2/19/2016,Van Niekerk stars in historic South Africa wi,cricket,CAPE TOWN,Dane van Niekerk;Danielle;Charlotte;Marizanne Kapp;Chetty;Rebecca;Heather Knight;Anya;Shrubsole;Trisha;Sarah Taylor;Sarah;Kapp;Knight;Rebecca Grundy;Grundy;van Niekerk;van;Charlotte Edwards;Heather;Preez;Taylor;Anya Shrubsole;Hazell;Niekerk;Gunn;Marizanne;Trisha Chetty;Dane;Edwards;Danielle Hazell;Jenny Gunn;Jenny,Van Niekerk,

"CHRISTCHURCH: Brendon McCullum blasted the fastest test century to rescue New Zealand before Australia were reduced to 57 for one by the close of day one of the second test on Saturday.The New Zealand captain scored a brilliant 145, with his first 100 runs coming from 54 balls, as the hosts were dismissed for 370 after tea at Hagley Oval in Christchurch.Trent Boult then had the dangerous David Warner caught at second slip by Martin Guptill for 12, before Joe Burns (27) and Usman Khawaja (18) saw the Australians through to the close.New Zealand had no right to be in the position they were at stumps after being sent in to bat by Steve Smith on a green wicket and reduced to 32 for three inside 20 overs.McCullum, playing his 101st and final test with his team trailing 1-0 in the two-match series, led a counter-attack that began before lunch and reached its bludgeoning best in the afternoon session.Fast bowlers were charged, nicks flew and improvisation mixed with pure cricket shots as McCullum and Corey Anderson took to Australias bowlers in 75 scintillating minutes after lunch.The onslaught came after McCullum was caught in the gully by Mitchell Marsh when on 39, only to be recalled as television replays showed fast bowler James Pattinson had over-stepped.Already bristling with aggression, the second life flicked a switch for McCullum and he went into all-out attack mode, reaching his century 24 balls later with his 16th boundary.He needed two fewer balls than the 56 that West Indies Viv Richards required for his century against England in Antigua in 1986 and Pakistans Misbah-ul-Haq took against Australia in Abu Dhabi in 2014.McCullum also hit four sixes in his first 100 runs, his first before lunch securing outright ownership of the record for career sixes in test cricket.He had started the day tied with Australias Adam Gilchrist on 100. He was eventually dismissed when Nathan Lyon took a good catch in the deep to end a 179-run partnership with Anderson, who reached his fourth test half-century from 39 balls and was dismissed for 72 shortly before tea.Lyon grabbed two wickets after tea, with wicketkeeper BJ Watling the last man out for 58.Until McCullum and Andersons pyro-technics, Australia had been well in control, reducing the hosts to 74 for four with Kane Williamsons dismissal for seven after lunch.Williamson had tried to rebuild New Zealands innings under pressure from superb pace bowling that captured the wickets of Martin Guptill (18), Tom Latham (four) and Henry Nicholls (seven).",2/20/2016,McCullum smashes fastest test century,cricket,CHRISTCHURCH,Viv;Mitchell Marsh;Latham;James Pattinson;Richards;Watling;David Warner;Joe;Henry Nicholls;Smith;Brendon;Nathan Lyon;Adam;Viv Richards;Brendon McCullum;Gilchrist;Tom;Guptill;David;Burns;Usman;Nicholls;Usman Khawaja;BJ;Tom Latham;Corey Anderson;Warner;Misbah-ul-Haq;Nathan;Mitchell;Joe Burns;Steve Smith;McCullum;BJ Watling;Henry;James;Boult;Australias Adam Gilchrist;Lyon;Pattinson;Martin;Australias;Anderson;Martin Guptill;Steve;Marsh;Khawaja;Corey,McCullum;Brendon McCullum,Andersons;Kane Williamsons
"DUBAI: Aizaz Cheema took two wickets including the key one of Wahab Riaz in the last over to help Quetta Gladiators beat Peshawar Zalmi by only 1 run to reach the final of first-ever Pakistan Super League (PSL) here on Friday.Riaz got out on the penultimate delivery of the final over ironically caught by Ahmed Shehzad, who was involved with him in a collision when they faced each other in their encounter during the league stages.Mohammad Asghar could not hit the much needed boundary on the last ball giving away Gladiators the victory in a nail-biting finish to the match.Besides Wahab Riaz, only Darren Sammy put some resistance in the Gladiators way to the victory scoring 38 runs off 29 balls.Grant Elliottt and Mohammad Nawaz grabbed three wickets each while Cheema ended up with two wickets for 34 and Anwar Ali with a wicket for 28 runs. Nawaz was given the man of the match award for his brilliant all-round performance.Earlier, despite glimpses of brilliance from Kevin Pietersen and Kumar Sangakkara, Quetta Gladiators managed to post a moderate target of 134 for Peshawar Zalmi in the first playoff at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.Pietersen made a 38-ball 53 including 5 fours and 2 sixes while the Sri Lanka great scored 37 off 29 with 6 fours.

"JOHANNESBURG: Sarah Taylor scored a third successive half-century and became the second player after Charlotte Edwards to score 2000 runs in the format as England sealed the three-match series against South Africa 2-1. Taylor anchored a relatively straightforward chase - the first time England have batted second in the series - after captain Edwards opted to bowl first under cloudy skies and England restricted their opposition to 131 for 4.England took advantage of the swing on offer and reduced South Africa to 6 for 3 in the second over before Mignon du Preez and Lizelle Lee built the recovery. They shared an 89-run stand for the fourth wicket to engineer a strong comeback - Lee's unbeaten 69 off 61 balls was a career-best - but South Africa's score on a good pitch and a fast outfield, never looked enough.South Africa's problems started early when Tash Farrant, the left-armer making her first appearance in the series, had Trish Chetty stumped down the leg side off a wide. In the next over, Anya Shrubsole found movement and bowled Dane van Niekerk, who was playing in her 50th T20I, and Marizanne Kapp with successive inswinging deliveries. She was not far away from a hat-trick with another full and straight delivery to Lee but a thin inside edge saved the batsman.Lee kept her composure and rebuilt steadily with her captain, du Preez. They complemented each other well with Lee the aggressor and du Preez the accumulator. The ninth over was the most profitable with Lee taking 15 runs off Jenny Gunn before offering a chance. Lee was on 30 and hit the last ball of the over to long off but Heather Knight could not hold on.South Africa still had work to do at 49 for 3 at the halfway stage. Du Preez shifted gears and helped by some ordinary fielding from England, started to speed up the scoring rate. South Africa managed 26 runs in three overs before Farrant was brought back to quieten things down.With not even 100 on the board and only four overs left, South Africa's urgency grew. Du Preez was run out by a direct hit after a trying to steal a second off a Knight fumble and it was up to Lee to finish strongly. She reached 50 off 51 balls immediately after du Preez was dismissed and played a part in South Africa scoring 35 runs off the last three overs. They still ended with the lowest first-innings score of the series and would have known it would be tough to defend.England were into their task early when Amy Jones climbed into overpitched deliveries from Shabnim Ismail. She scored 14 runs off the first over before Ismail had her caught behind. But, as was the case in Cape Town when South Africa made the early breakthrough, it brought England's best pair together but this time it was not for too long. While Taylor scored freely, Edwards could not get away and gifted deep square leg a catch to give South Africa some hope, although with Taylor at the crease, England could always feel safe.Taylor went aerial with confidence and was strong on the drive and cut. With Knight playing a supporting role, England were well on their way. Taylor brought up fifty off 33 balls and thoughb Knight was dismissed off the next ball England needed just 40 off 58 balls.South Africa claimed a few consolation wickets - van Niekerk took a stunning one-handed return catch in her follow through to dismiss Taylor and Ismail bowled Nat Sciver and Danielle Wyatt with full deliveries in the same over - but England reached the target with 4.3 overs to spare.

"CHRISTCHURCH: Joe Burns and Steve Smith capitalised on perfect batting conditions to score centuries as Australia reduced New Zealands lead to just seven runs at the end of day two of the second Test on Sunday.Neil Wagner dismissed both batsmen in identical fashion in the final half-hour to give his side some late reward for a day of toil under a cloudless Christchurch sky.Burns, who had been dismissed early in his innings only to have the decision overturned on review, was well caught low down by Martin Guptill at square leg for 170, his highest Test score and third century.Smith also fell to a short ball in Wagners next over for 138, his 14th Test century, caught by the same fielder.Adam Voges was on two with nightwatchman Nathan Lyon on four as the visitors ended the day 363 for four, having all but mowed down New Zealands first innings 370.Having won the opener in Wellington comprehensively, Australia need only draw in Christchurch to clinch the two-match series and take the number one ranking in Test cricket.New Zealands only other success on a wicket offering little for the bowlers was when Usman Khawaja fell in the first hour for 24 off paceman Trent Boult.Burns and Smith then combined in a 289-run third wicket partnership, a record for Australia against New Zealand.Burns was given out caught behind on 35 but immediately asked for a review and television replays showed the Matt Henry delivery had brushed his forearm and not his gloves.

"CHRISTCHURCH: Tom Latham and Kane Williamson steered New Zealand to 43 for one in their second innings at tea on Monday, after Martin Guptill went for a duck, as the hosts reduced Australia's lead on the third day of the second test to 92 runs.New Zealand were in trouble on eight for one when Guptill failed to move his feet and nibbled a catch through to Peter Nevill from James Pattinson.However, Latham and Williamson steadied the ship, reaching 33 and 10 respectively at the break.New Zealand, who posted 370 in their first innings, struggled to break down Australia's batting for more than four sessions but took five wickets in the first hour after lunch.The visitors had gone to lunch at 455 for five before Neil Wagner added the wickets of Adam Voges (60) and Mitchell Marsh (18) to the two he took on Sunday.Wagner then completed his second five-wicket haul when he had Nevill caught by wicketkeeper BJ Watling for 13, and then Josh Hazlewood caught at first slip by Brendon McCullum for the same score to end Austrlia's innings on 505.Wagner finished the innings with career-best figures of 6-106.Corey Anderson took the other wicket to fall after lunch, with Pattinson caught at point by Trent Boult, in New Zealand's most successful period in the two-match series.Spectators at the venue observed a minute's silence at 1251 (2351 GMT) to commemorate the fifth anniversary of a devastating earthquake in Christchurch that killed 185 people.Players from both sides wore black arm-bands for the day's play and stood while the big screen displayed a message remembering those who died.New Zealand's only success in the first session was when nightwatchman Nathan Lyon was well caught low down at slip by McCullum from part-time spinner Williamson for 33.Lyon and Voges had combined for 81 runs to frustrate New Zealand, with McCullum using seven different bowlers in the session in a bid to break through.

"CHRISTCHURCH: Joe Burns and Usman Khawaja reduced Australias victory target to 131 runs with nine wickets in hand at the end of the fourth day of the second Test against New Zealand at Hagley Oval on Tuesday.Burns was on 27, while Khawaja was 19 not out with Australia 70 for one after being set 201 runs to win the match and series 2-0.They had earlier dismissed the hosts in their second innings for 335 after tea.David Warner was the only wicket to fall when he was caught down the leg side by BJ Watling from Neil Wagner for 22, though New Zealand needed to ask for a review to determine the ball had glanced his gloves.Jackson Bird grabbed his first five-wicket haul to help wrap up New Zealands second innings after tea that had been characterised by stubborn middle and lower-order resistance.Bird, who had grabbed three quick wickets after lunch, including the key scalp of Kane Williamson (97), bowled Matt Henry for 66 -- his first half century and highest score -- then had Trent Boult caught for a duck to finish with 5-59.James Pattinson finished with 4-77, but had the most important wicket in the final session on Tuesday when he dismissed Watling for 46 after the wicketkeeper had combined with Henry in a crucial 118-run partnership.Until their eighth-wicket stand, the hosts had been in danger of being dismissed with a lead of only about 100 after Bird had broken a 102-run partnership between Williamson and Corey Anderson (40) that had got their side into credit.The pair batted through a heated first session in which Australia dropped two catches, had two reviews turned down and an lbw decision overturned.The second review, just before lunch and against Williamson, prompted a petulant outburst from captain Steve Smith and Josh Hazlewood, with the tall fast bowler likely to face further sanctions after microphones picked up his expletive-laden rant.New Zealand had begun the day on 121 for four, 14 runs in arrears of Australias 505, but their stubborn resistance ensured the match would enter a fifth and final day.The target also appeared competitive though not overly challenging on a good batting surface and Australia should seal victory to reclaim the number one ranking in Test cricket, though Anderson said his side would make it tough for the visitors.

"ISLAMABAD: Pakistans inaugural national cricket league has been an unexpected success, even though all the matches have been played in the United Arab Emirates.Since the Pakistan Super League (PSL) was announced last September, the countrys cricket board has sold five franchises for $93 million and attracted players from 11 different countries.They include big names like West Indies batsman Chris Gayle and former internationals Kumar Sangakkara of Sri Lanka and Englands Kevin Pietersen.The biggest surprise, however, has been the response from Pakistans public.Since matches began in the UAE on Feb. 4, television viewing figures have been higher than for the 2015 World Cup.Tuesdays championship match between Islamabad United and Quetta Gladiators in Dubai is expected to attract similar figures.The match is sold out.""Big businesses have bought the franchises, millions of people have tuned in even though the matches arent in Pakistan, and our own young cricketers are getting a chance to rub shoulders with giants,"" PSL chairman Najam Sethi told Reuters.""This is the most extraordinary moment for Pakistani cricket since we were exiled from the international game.""strong>HOME SOIL</strongIt is still unclear when the PSL will be able to stage its first match on home soil.Pakistan has been forced to play designated home matches primarily in the United Arab Emirates since 2009 when the Sri Lankan team was ambushed by militants while travelling from their hotel to Lahores Gaddafi stadium for a test match.Many see PSL as a turning-point, not just for the countrys cash-strapped cricket board but also for young cricketers who have missed out on opportunities to interact with and learn from leading international players.Among those who have bought the franchise are Habib Bank Limited, the countrys biggest bank, Haier Group, a major electronics and home appliances company, and Qatar Oil.If all goes according to plan, PSL will generate revenues of approximately $50 million, according to cricket board estimates.A 10-year forecast sees the board making profits of $50-60 million.Given the size of Pakistans potential market of 180 million people, cricket experts say it is possible to imagine the PSL becoming one of the worlds biggest cricket leagues.""It would not be outlandish to say that PSL could soon be the worlds third largest league,"" Osman Samiuddin, author of The Unquiet Ones: A History of Pakistan Cricket, said, comparing PSL to the Indian and Australian domestic leagues.""Looking at how successful this season has been, how much the public has enjoyed it, and the fact that it has generated a real revenue stream for the cricket board, I would say its possible.""Despite the success of PSLs first season, the real test for the cricket board will be if it can permanently bring the game back home.""Next year, we hope to have at least the opening and closing PSL matches on Pakistani soil,"" PSL Chairman Sethi said.

"CHRISTCHURCH: Australia returned to the top of the test world rankings on Wednesday after Steve Smith and Adam Voges steered the tourists to victory in the second test against New Zealand to seal a comprehensive 2-0 series win.After thrashing the hosts in the first test by an innings and 52 runs in Wellington last week, Australia sealed the second match by seven wickets shortly after lunch on the fifth and final day at Hagley Oval.It was Australia's seventh win in 11 games under Smith's captaincy, while the match was also the 101st and final test for New Zealand skipper Brendon McCullum, who now heads into international retirement.Australia were last at the summit of test cricket in July 2014 and Smith set course for a return when he assumed the captaincy from Michael Clarke full time after last year's Ashes loss to England.""We want to win every series we play. We want to win a lot more away from home and that was a good start for us,"" Smith said. ""We had a lot of patience in the way we played and ...all the guys are really confident in their skills.""McCullum, who will still play on the lucrative Twenty20 circuit, praised his team mates for their achievements during his reign as captain.""We've had some fun over the last few years,"" he said. ""We've achieved some things and hey, we've lost some games as well, but we've got our soul back and you're absolutely great men.""For the rest of my life I'll remember playing for New Zealand. I firmly believe this team will go to a new level over the next couple of years.""Magnanimous McCullum also congratulated Australia on their return to the top of the rankings.""You guys have proved why you are the number one test team in the world,"" he added. ""When you arrived here we felt we were a chance and you blew us off the park in both tests and showed why you are such a quality team.""Smith ended the match on 53 not out, his 16th test half century and follows up his 138 in the first innings. Voges hit the winning runs, a boundary through the covers to move to 10 and take the visitors to 201 for three.Australia had looked like achieving their victory target when they reached 169 for two at the scheduled lunch break before man of the match Joe Burns (65) was bowled by Trent Boult in the additional four overs offered by the umpires.Voges and Smith then opted to see out victory after the break.Usman Khawaja (45) was the only other wicket to fall in the first session on Wednesday when he was well held by McCullum at first slip off Tim Southee.Australia had only needed to draw the match at Hagley Oval to retake the top ranking in test cricket from India.",2/24/2016,Smith leads Australia back to test summi,cricket,CHRISTCHURCH,Southee.Australia;Michael Clarke;Michael;Joe Burns;Trent;Trent Boult;Steve Smith;McCullum;Tim Southee.Australia;Clarke;Joe;Boult;Smith;Brendon;Adam Voges;Adam;Brendon McCullum;Voges;Steve;Tim;Burns;Khawaja,Smith;Steve Smith,

"ZURICH: Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini, once the two most powerful men in world football, had their bans for ethics violations upheld on Wednesday, although they were reduced from eight years to six.The 79-year-old Blatter, who served for 17 years as FIFA president, and Platini, 60, one of the greatest players of all time and UEFA president since 2007, had appealed against the bans imposed last October.The ruling came two days before FIFA holds a special elective Congress to appoint a successor to Blatter, who was President of the ruling body from 1998 before standing down four days after winning his final term of office last May.Neither man will be at Friday's Congress following the decision and Platini could hardly contain his wrath.""The decision is insulting, shameful and is a violation of rights,"" he said in a statement.""The charges against me are baseless, built from the ground up and surreal in view of the facts and the explanations I gave during the hearing.""I will go to the end of my fight to show that Im innocent, to restore my rights and identify who is responsible for this plot.""There was no immediate response from Blatter.strong>DARK NIGHT</strongThe pair will now turn to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) for the last chance to restore their reputations and roles in the game.The final verdict from FIFA's headquarters, though, came on a rainy evening in Zurich.The statement issued by the Appeal Panel, while upholding the ban, did determine that ""some strong mitigating factors for Mr Platini and Mr Blatter were not taken into account when establishing the sanction.""One of the factors for reducing the ban was the pair's lifetime service to football.Blatter and Platini were banned over a payment of 2 million Swiss francs ($2.03 million) made to the Frenchman in 2011 by FIFA with Blatter's approval for work done a decade earlier.They said the payment honoured a verbal or gentleman's agreement made in 1998 for work carried out by the Frenchman when he was a technical adviser to Blatter.strong>SUSPENSION IMPOSED</strongThe decision not to overturn the bans followed the 12-year suspension imposed on Jerome Valcke, who was sacked as FIFA's secretary general last month.Valcke, the man responsible for running FIFA's day-to-day administration, was found guilty of misconduct over the sale of World Cup tickets, abuse of travel expenses, attempting to sell TV rights below their market value and destruction of evidence.Platini was European Footballer of the Year three times while Blatter worked at FIFA for 41 years after originally joining as Technical Director in 1975. He served as Secretary General from 1981 until he succeeded Joao Havelange as president in 1998.Blatter's reign was mired in controversy and the announcement that he was resigning came in June, less than a week after American and Swiss authorities arrested FIFA and other officials at a Zurich hotel on corruption charges, two days before the Congress and election took place.Platini was, for many years, regarded as Blatter's natural successor and they worked harmoniously before rifts occurred in their relationship.Platini was openly critical of Blatter in the run-up to last year's election, but both have been united again in being brought down by the scandal that has rocked their sport.",2/25/2016,Blatter and Platini bans reduced to six year,football,ZURICH,Michel Platini;Havelange;Sepp Blatter;Blatter;Michel;Sepp;Valcke;Joao Havelange;Joao;Jerome;Jerome Valcke;Platini,Blatter;Platini;Sepp Blatter;Michel Platini,Congress;Court of Arbitration for Sport;UEFA;CAS;FIFA

"DHAKA: World crickets most intriguing rivalry will once again be renewed when India take on an unpredictable Pakistan with rehabilitated pacer Mohammed Amir being the focus of attention in a roundrobin league encounter of the Asia Cup T20 tournament here today (Saturday).The match will also serve as a precursor to the two teams opening round battle in the ICC World Twenty20 next month.The IndoPak cricket contests over the years have carried a legacy not to forget the political undercurrents involved whenever the two bitter neighbours square off on the 22 yards.But the most exciting aspect will be whether the tainted Amir gets to play in the XI.Back after serving a fiveyear ban for spotfixing Amir has started playing for the national team since the tour of New Zealand and this immensely talented bowler will certainly come out all guns blazing against the Indian batsmen.Virat Kohli has already welcomed Amir s return but not much is known as to what other Indian players including skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni think about the convicted spot fixer s inclusion.In India, the BCCI has taken a zero tolerance approach imposing life bans on players like S Sreesanth, Ankeet Chavan, Ajit Chandila who have no hopes of returning to competitive cricket.For Amir, though a good performance against India will probably help him gain some credibility not only in the dressing room but also among the common cricketloving public in Pakistan.In terms of preparation, both teams have been suitably prepared considering the amount of Twenty20 cricket they have played in the past one month.India already kicked off their World T20 preparations in style having won six out of the seven games played so far.Pakistan cricketers on the other hand are coming straight after playing in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) which keeps them well prepared.Traditionally, India have never ever lost to Pakistan in the global events but it has not been the case in the continental event where Shahid Afridi and co have performed well.However the Asia Cup has never been played in the T20 format which is also a first.

"ZURICH: Crisis-hit world football governing body FIFA faces one of the most important days in its 112-year history when it elects a new leader on Friday hoping to usher in a fresh era after decades of tawdry controversy.Delegates from more than 200 countries will vote for a new president to succeed Sepp Blatter, two days after the disgraced Swiss and European football chief Michel Platini lost their appeals against bans for ethics violations.A wide-ranging set of reforms, which are designed to prevent corruption, will be voted on before the FIFA election and are expected to be passed. They include term limits for top officials and disclosure of their earnings.Whoever takes over from Blatter, who ran FIFA for 17 years like a globe-trotting head of state, will inherit a very different job with the focus on crisis management, after dozens of international football officials were indicted in the United States last year for racketeering, money-laundering and bribery.Asian Football Confederation (AFC) president Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa is the bookmaker's favourite with UEFA's Swiss general secretary Gianni Infantino a close second.Jordanian Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein believes he is still firmly in the race however, while Frenchman Jerome Champagne and South African Tokyo Sexwale will hope to make an impact.There was little indication on Thursday, though, that the vote would be anything other than a two-horse race between Sheikh Salman and Infantino.""I am feeling good and very positive. The support I am receiving fills me with confidence, Infantino told Reuters.A spokesman for his Bahraini rival said: ""Sheikh Salman is very confident about tomorrows vote.""The CONCACAF confederation for North and Central America and the Caribbean opted against endorsing a candidate and delegates suggested that support within the region was divided.With no block vote from those 35 delegates, Africa's decision now looks set to be the decisive factor.African countries make up more than a quarter of the 207 football associations eligible to vote. On the final day of campaigning, there were sharply conflicting versions of how they would cast their ballots.While the vice-president of their continental federation said virtually all would back Sheikh Salman, several delegates told Reuters the African vote would be split.Infantino has said he was confident of winning more than half of the African votes, while Liberian football chief Musa Bility predicted the possibly unlikely scenario of 27 of the region's votes going to Jordan's Prince Ali.""The world is waiting and watching -- this is the biggest milestone in the history of FIFA. It will decide if FIFA goes ahead as we want or if it spirals down,"" Prince Ali told delegates.Former anti-apartheid militant turned businessman and politician Sexwale described FIFA as broken and a damaged brand, though he also referred to some of those felled in the scandal as ""friends we have lost"".Infantino repeated his promise to offer each of FIFA's members $5 million to invest in the sport over four years, more than doubling the $2.05 million each federation got from 2011-14. He said this could be achieved ""easily"" by tackling the cost structure of FIFA.Bahrain's Salman was again more cautious, though, speaking of a 'realistic' increase in funding.""For me, if the numbers are right, we can increase -- but I am not ready to mortgage FIFAs future in winning an election.""French outsider Champagne took a shot at Infantinos globe-trotting campaign by saying the election had been ""unbalanced"".""I did not have a private jet to visit you, take a photo and then tweet and say I have got the endorsement,"" he said to laughter from delegates.Prince Ali told UEFA delegates if he won the election he would appoint a European as his secretary general but did not offer up a name.CORRUPTION PROBESFIFA was plunged into turmoil by the corruption scandal that broke last year, beginning with a dawn raid to arrest delegates at a Swiss luxury hotel.Criminal investigations led by the United States and Switzerland have spanned dozens of countries, focusing largely on the awarding of lucrative broadcast and marketing rights to the world's most popular sport.They are also examining the process by which FIFA awarded the next two World Cups to Russia and Qatar.Acting FIFA president Issa Hayatou appealed to FIFA members in what he called one of the most important weeks in the history of global football, calling on them to back the package of reforms on governance.""I urge each of you to support the reforms in full here this week, and then to implement them to their entirety at home,"" Hayatou said in an address aimed at the six confederations that run football around the world.""This will send a strong message that we have listened and that we are taking the action necessary to give football the Foundation, and protection, it needs for the future.""",2/26/2016,FIFA aims to start afresh with vote to replace Blatter,football,ZURICH,Issa Hayatou;Hayatou;Michel Platini;bin;Sepp Blatter;Khalifa;Gianni Infantino;Al;Champagne;Sheikh Salman;Blatter;Michel;Sepp;Sexwale;Ebrahim;Jerome Champagne;Bin;Ali Bin Al Hussein;Infantino;Hussein;Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa;Musa;Bility;Salman;Gianni;Musa Bility;Issa;Jerome;Sheikh;Platini;Ali,Blatter;Sepp Blatter,Reuters;UEFA;Reuters.A;Infantinos;Tokyo Sexwale;FIFA

"ZURICH: Gianni Infantino vowed on Friday to lead FIFA out of years of corruption and scandal after the former UEFA general secretary was elected to succeed his Swiss compatriot Sepp Blatter as president of football's world governing body.""We will restore the image of FIFA and the respect of FIFA, and everyone in the world will be proud of us,"" the 45-year-old law graduate, who for the last seven years has been the leading administrator for Europe's governing body, told an extraordinary FIFA Congress in Zurich.""I feel a lot of emotion and have not realised yet what has happened today.""After a first round of voting in which he narrowly beat Asian Football Confederation President Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa of Bahrain, Infantino appeared to gather up almost all the votes that had been cast for the two trailing candidates, Prince Ali and Jerome Champagne.He won 115 of the 207 votes in the second round, giving him a simple majority ensuring a European again holds the top job until 2019 and frustrating the hopes of those looking for a swing to Asia.Infantino owed his candidacy to the fact that Europe's preferred candidate, his former boss and UEFA president Michel Platini, was banned from football last year along with Blatter for ethics violations.""I thank Michel Platini for everything that he has taught me and given me and the work we have done together,"" Infantino said. ""I have strong, dear thoughts for Mr Michel Platini right now.""Only the ninth president in FIFA's 112-year history, he inherits a very different job from that enjoyed by Blatter, who toured the world for 17 years like a head of state, dispensing development funds to his global support base.Before the election, the Congress had overwhelmingly passed a set of reforms intended to make FIFA more transparent, professional and accountable.That package should mean the new president faces much closer scrutiny than Blatter did -- his salary will be published for the first time -- and have less influence over the day-to-day management of the organisation's business affairs.",2/27/2016,Infantino chosen to lead FIFA into new er,football,ZURICH,Prince Ali;Michel Platini;bin;Sepp Blatter;Khalifa;Gianni Infantino;Al;Blatter;Prince;Champagne.He;Michel;Sepp;Ebrahim;Jerome Champagne.He;Infantino;Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa;Gianni;Salman;Jerome;Sheikh;Platini;Ali,Infantino;Gianni Infantino,Congress;FIFA Congress;UEFA;Asian Football Confederation;FIFA

"DHAKA: Coming jubilant from UAE following successful holding of Pakistan Super League (PSL), but the men in green conceded a humiliating defeat from arch-rival India in their Asia Cup opener, which they would want to forget as soon as possible starting with a big victory against minnows UAE when the two teams clash on Monday here in Mirpur.For its part, Pakistan was taken by surprise at the way the pitch played on Saturday, Shoaib Malik said after Pakistan was defeated by India.Pakistan slipped and slid to 83 against India, Sarfraz Ahmeds 24-ball 25 the only innings of substance. Mohammad Amir put in a fantastic spell at the top of Indias innings to keep Pakistan in the game, but only just.We made some mistakes. We didnt know what the conditions here would be. Now we have played, now we know how to deal with it, said Malik on the sidelines of the Pakistan teams training session on the afternoon before the match.We had miscalculated. It wasnt a typical T20 wicket where you look at 170 or 180. We know we have the best attack among all teams. But the batsmen have to take responsibility. Whoever gets in has to score 60-70, so the team ends up scoring 140-150, which the bowlers can defend.We should have scored 130. We had two run outs. Otherwise one of them might have gone on to score 40-50. Here, 130-plus is a great score, unless the conditions change.<br/> <br/> Its unlikely that Pakistan will be worrying too much about its bowling. Amir, as well as Mohammad Sami, bowled extremely well against India, while Mohammad Irfan troubled Indias batsmen no end. Wahab Riaz did, however, have an average day, but it could well have been an aberration.Like with UAE, its the batting that Pakistan has to address. And fast. Both Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have already beaten UAE and India could too, going by form. So winning on Monday is non-negotiable for Pakistan. But the idea must be put up a big performance - with the ball, of course; even more so with the bat.<br/> <br/> Since qualifying for this level in 2014, UAE has played three Twenty20 Internationals against Test-playing nations, two of them in this tournament and one against Zimbabwe earlier. To its credit, UAE have gone about it manfully, bowling well and showing good spirit on the field. Sri Lanka was restricted to 129 for 8 and Bangladesh for a similar 133 for 8.

"DUBAI: Stan Wawrinka edged out Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis in a nerve-jangling, near-30 minute tiebreak to secure the Dubai Duty Free Championship with a 6-4 7-6(13) triumph on Saturday.Wawrinkas path to victory had been eased by the retirements of world number one Novak Djokovic and Australian prospect Nick Kyrgios in the earlier rounds but the Swiss often toiled against surprise finalist Baghdatis, whom he beat for a sixth successive time.World number four Wawrinka was gifted the first set by a Baghdatis double fault -- his third of that game alone -- and a tepid second set was notable for not featuring a single break point.But then followed a 28-point tiebreak in which twice grand slam champion Wawrinka saved five set points before a Baghdatis backhand drifted long to give the Swiss a second title of the year following his victory in Chennai in January.Baghdatis initially played serve and volley with aplomb, while Wawrinkas stinging backhand was lethal from the baseline, but that early assurance proved fleeting as both players made a catalogue of errors.Wawrinka afforded Baghdatis two break points after whipping a forehand wide and the Cypriot converted following another wayward Swiss forehand for a 3-2 first-set lead.Wawrinka, who was within two points of suffering opening-round elimination at the Aviation Club, immediately broke back with a crosscourt winner past the advancing Baghdatis, who was seeking a first title since 2010.The pair were content to trade half-paced shots from the back of the court and when either did up the tempo it usually failed.World number 57 Baghdatis, serving at 4-5, saved four set points but his serve deserted him again as he conceded the set.The second set went with serve before an attritional tiebreak in which Baghdatis fluffed chances to square the match and Wawrinka threw his racket in frustration after missing an easy forehand.

"EAST LONDON: Trisha Chetty and Dane van Niekerk both stroked half-centuries, paving the way for South Africa Women's 35-run win against West Indies Women in East London. Victory was not of much significance, though, as West Indies had already sealed the three-match series having won the first two ODIs.South Africa, opting to bat, compiled a score of 235 for 6, built on the back of two big partnerships. First, Chetty (55) and Mignon du Preez (43) added 72 for the second wicket, before Marizanne Kapp (39) and van Niekerk provided the innings late impetus by stringing together a 64-run fifth-wicket stand. Van Niekerk slammed 55 off 48 balls before being run out.West Indies, in reply, lost their opener Hayley Matthews early in the chase, but Shaquana Quintyne and Kyshona Knight led a recovery with a 57-run partnership for the second wicket. However, just when they seemed steady, the visitors lost wickets in a cluster to soon fall to 118 for 5.

"ISLAMABAD: Pakistans new bowling coach Azhar Mahmood believes Pakistan teams fast bowling attack is the best in the world at present, saying the pace trio of Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Irfan and Wahab Riaz is outstanding.Azhar who has replaced bowling coach Mushtaq Ahmed (who has been rested for Asia Cup and World Twenty20 due to fatigue) said that Amir, Irfan and Wahab are among the best fast bowling attacks in the world at present.We have one of the best bowling sides in the world and Amir is a proven match-winner and then you add a seven footer Irfan who has an advantage of height, the pace battery of the side looks really exciting. Not to forget we have Wahab Riaz as well, Azhar was quoted as saying by indiatoday.intoday.in.He said Pakistan have Amirs variety, Irfans height and Riazs pace which makes for a threatening pace attack.The inclusion of Mohammad Sami only adds to the variety of the attack who can bowl at 145 kmph, he said.For Azhar a phone call from former teammate and current Pakistan head coach Waqar Younis was motivation enough to take up the assignment.I got a call from Waqar a week ago when I was playing Pakistans domestic T20 league.He asked me if I was interested in this role and I said yes in the blink of an eye.I had other commitments after the World T20 so this role suited me perfectly, he said.These guys have been working hard for the last two years with Waqar. My job is to only pass on my knowledge and skills and give them more confidence when it comes to executing bowling plans. I am enjoying each moment of mine with the Pakistan team and hopefully I can pass on my experience to the younger lot in the line up, he said.I have played around the world and have enough experience under my belt to help them with little things.

"Fledgling forward Marcus Rashford is keen to continue his ""crazy"" start to life in the Manchester United first team after impressing with two more goals in Sunday's 3-2 win over title-chasing Arsenal.The 18-year-old's double against the Gunners came after he notched twice on his first team debut in the 5-1 dismantling of Danish side Midtjylland in the Europa League on Thursday and the young forward was as blown away as anyone by his instant impact.""It's just crazy. This is my first game in the Premier League so obviously it's been amazing, and to score two has been a bonus. So hopefully we can carry it on and go again the next game,"" Rashford told Sky Sports.Rashford said his late inclusion on Thursday, after Anthony Martial was injured in the warm-up, had probably helped him.""It was a shock playing midweek ... But that maybe benefited me because I wasn't thinking about the game too much, so it's been good,"" the Manchester-born player said.The victory over Arsenal left United in fifth, three points behind Manchester City who have a game in hand on their rivals and occupy the final Champions League qualifying spot.Spanish midfielder Juan Mata heaped praise on his young team mate but also highlighted the impact of the other academy graduates, who have plugged the holes of United's injury-ravaged first team squad of late.""Marcus is on fire. He scored two goals against Midtjylland and now again against Arsenal,"" Mata told the club's website.""... but the others who came in to play in defence and midfield were also great.

"SIMLA: A keenly-awaited clash between India and Pakistan in the 2016 T20 ICC World Cup  to be played in Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh  might just not happen, or be moved to another city.Himachal Pradesh Congress on Sunday asked the BCCI to either cancel the proposed India-Pakistan T20 World Cup match slated for March 19 at Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh or shift the venue to any other city.The executive of the Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee also criticised the secretary of Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and BJP MP Anurag Thakur for the decision to hold the match in Dharamsala.Leaders of the Congress party, which rules the state, are asking the Indian cricket board to cancel the match in order to ""respect sentiments"" of family members of those killed in the 2 January terrorist attack on the nearby Pathankot air base, allegedly by Pakistani men.At the least, the 19 March game should be played elsewhere, the politicians have told the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).

"DHAKA: On the face of it, the India v Sri Lanka game at the Asia Cup T20 2016 at Sher-e-Bangla Stadium in Mirpur on Tuesday (March 1) pits two sides, who have had contrasting recent form against each other.India has done most things right so far. In the opener against Bangladesh, the batsmen started slowly but Rohit Sharma and Hardik Pandya exploded towards the close, and the bowling pack did exactly what MS Dhoni would have hoped for to stop the opposition well short. The win over Pakistan was equally comprehensive. Apart from three overs from Mohammad Amir early on and a phase when Mohammad Irfan troubled Yuvraj Singh, it was one-way traffic.Sri Lanka, on the other hand, started well via Tillakaratne Dilshan and Dinesh Chandimal in its first game against UAE but ended up scoring only 129 for 8. And though there was never any real danger of the target being crossed, it took Lasith Malingas brilliance to ensure the chase stopped at 115 for 9. Against Bangladesh, with Malinga sitting out, Sri Lanka was overwhelmed.There was no word on Malingas availability for the match, discomfort in the knee making his comeback after three months out last only one game. A team spokesperson said that Malinga was recovering. Keeping the ICC World Twenty20 2016 in mind, Malinga probably will be fielded only if the team is confident that it wont be harmful for him in the longer run.India might also be without Rohit Sharma, the inswinging yorker from Amir that sent him on his way on Saturday having left an impact on Rohits left big toe. He didnt train on Monday, though it was announced that there was no fracture and Rohit wasnt in any pain.The good news for India, meanwhile, was that Shikhar Dhawan was in fine fettle the day before the game, spending a fair bit of time knocking the ball around in the nets.<br/> <br/> India has been on a roll of late, while Sri Lanka hasnt had things going its way. The last series either side played was against each other - a three-match affair in India, where India lost in the first match in Pune, but the then bounced back well to take the series 2-1.The pitches for all but one Asia Cup match have been pacer friendly, much like the track in Pune was, where Kasun Rajitha, Dasun Shanaka and Dushmantha Chameera made the big-name India batting keel over.Sri Lanka did that in Pune. But everything India did in the three games before that in Australia and then the remainder of the series against Sri Lanka and then here at the Asia Cup suggest a team at the top of its game, with most cogs of wheel spinning smoothly.If Malinga makes a great recovery and gets on to the field, Sri Lanka will wear a stronger look but still not be the favourite on paper, with India doing all the heavy hitting so far.Teams (from)India: MS Dhoni (captain &amp; wk), R Ashwin, Jasprit Bumrah, Shikhar Dhawan, Harbhajan Singh, Ravindra Jadeja, Virat Kohli, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Pawan Negi, Ashish Nehra, Hardik Pandya, Parthiv Patel, Ajinkya Rahane, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Yuvraj Singh.Sri Lanka: Lasith Malinga (captain), Angelo Mathews, Dushmantha Chameera, Dinesh Chandimal (wk), Niroshan Dickwella, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Rangana Herath, Shehan Jayasuriya, Chamara Kapugedara, Nuwan Kulasekara, Thisara Perera, Sachithra Senanayake, Dasun Shanaka, Milinda Siriwardena, Jeffrey Vandersay.

Because it involves the security of our players, officials, people and media who will go to India for the event, sportskeeda.com quoted Mani as saying.Comparing the situation with Australias boycott of the 2016 Under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh, Mani quipped: If this match had involved the Australian team I am sure by now they would have pulled out of the match.They made their position on security for their players clear when they pulled out of the ICC Youth World Cup in Bangladesh earlier this year.Mani was also of the opinion that the PCB needed to make their stand on not playing in Dharamsala crystal clear.Talking about Pakistans attempt to re-establish Indo-Pakistan cricket relations Mani said: The Pakistan government has also shown it believes in having cricketing relations with India but I would think playing in Dharamsala in this environment would be risky for the Pakistan team.Meanwhile talks about an alternate venue have started to do the rounds however no decision has been made on this yet.

"LONDON: FIFA must make the 2026 World Cup bidding process ""absolutely bullet-proof"" because the entire organisation's credibility is at stake, new president Gianni Infantino said on Friday.Infantino, elected FIFA boss last week, hopes to start 2026 bidding within three months after it was delayed by the wide-reaching corruption scandal that rocked the governing body last year.""We have to get the 2026 bidding process absolutely right,"" Infantino told the BBC.""It's certainly the commitment that I want to give; that I will do everything I can to make sure that this happens because I think that the credibility of FIFA is, as well, at stake here.""We need to make sure that we do everything we possibly can, not only to prevent strange things to happen around bidding processes but also to prevent the perception that strange things could happen.""We need to make sure that bidding process that we put in place is absolutely bullet-proof.""Every World Cup bidding process since 1998 has been the subject of allegations of corruption and bribery.The awarding of the 2018 and 2022 finals, to Russia and Qatar respectively, is being probed by Swiss authorities.On Friday, a report into the bid for the 2006 World Cup awarded to Germany found no evidence of vote-rigging but was unable to explain a $10 million payment by the country's bid chief Franz Beckenbauer to a company owned by Mohammed Bin Hammam.Qatari Bin Hammam, a former president of the Asian Football Confederation, was banned from all soccer-related activity for life in December 2012 for integrity issues.Infantino reiterated his position that the 2018 and 2022 World Cups needed to go ahead, regardless of investigations.""I am a pragmatic person,"" he said. ""FIFA needs to deliver two World Cups, one in two years and one in six years, for decisions which have been taken six years ago.""There has been a lot of speculation and a lot of allegations but not one single fact, in six years.""At some stage we have to say 'let's focus on working'.

"NAGPUR: Afghanistan stretched their T20I record against Scotland to 6-0 with a 14-run win facilitated by their explosive opener Mohammad Shahzad and a spin-heavy attack to defend 170.Scotland were well on course in the chase after their openers packed a powerful stand of 84 runs in under nine overs, but the Afghanistan spinners dismissed the openers and then strangled the middle order to throw the chase off track.Scotland needed 77 runs from the half-way mark with eight wickets in hand but the Afghanistan spinners lived up to their captain's decision of batting first to allow the slower bowlers to do their work later on.On what looked like a slower pitch after the opening match in Nagpur, the two teams were set for much stronger totals after the platforms laid by their top orders. But both innings were jolted in the middle overs and Afghanistan eventually prevailed to start their World T20 campaign with a win, to bury memories of their Asia Cup opening-match loss against UAE last month.Shahzad started in his usual aggressive fashion and overcame some improvised bowling from the Scotland pacers in the Powerplay to cut loose later on.Shahzad and Noor Ali Zadran provided a flying start by putting on 25 in under three overs before Noor Ali steered a short ball straight to third man.Shahzad followed that by targeting the leg-side and straight boundaries to race towards a 32-ball fifty, his ninth in T20Is.",03-08-2016,Afghanistan defeat Scotland by 14 ru,cricket,NAGPUR,Mohammad Shahzad;Noor;Shahzad;Noor Ali Zadran;Zadran;Noor Ali;Mohammad;Ali,,UAE

He picked a spin-heavy attack comprising left-arm spinner Amir Hamza and leg-spinner Rashid Khan, to be followed by Samiullah Shenwari and Mohammad Nabi.

"NEW DELHI: Hosts India are favourites to clinch the sixth edition of the World Twenty20 in what could be a fairytale ending to the glittering career of captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni.India ranked number one in the world will seek to become the first side to win the International Cricket Council (ICC) title on home soil when the 16-team tournament gets under way on Tuesday.They are also gunning to become the tournaments only two-time winners with South Africa Australia and the mercurial West Indies shaping as leading threats.Australia, the topranked Test side, are desperate to win their first World Twenty20 crown while Pakistans Mohammad Amir will play his first ICC tournament since returning from a five-year spot-fixing ban.India come into the tournament on the back of an eight-wicket win over Bangladesh in the Asia Cup final and have several key batsmen and bowlers in form.Indias hot streak of 10 wins from their last 11 T20 internationals, coupled with their vast and boisterous home support, means Dhonis men will be tough to beat.India also have added incentive to lift the trophy on April 3 at Eden Gardens in Kolkata because of the fact that the tournament may mark Dhonis swansong.Dhoni, who led India to the inaugural title in 2007, has struggled with the bat of late and turns 35 this summer.In-form batsman Virat Kohli and deadly off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin are expected to be the key men for India, who are hosting the championship for the first time.The home side start their campaign against New Zealand on March 15 before playing archrivals Pakistan in Dharamsala four days later in a hotly awaited clash.Pakistan endured a disastrous Asia Cup, thanks largely to some atrocious batting and any hopes they have of making an impression will rely on the performances of the controversial Amir.The 23-year-old fast bowler was banned and jailed for deliberately sending down noballs in a Test match against England in 2010. But he has been in good touch since re-entering the international fold earlier this year and lit up the Asia Cup with a devastating 3-18 spell in Pakistans loss to India.Second-ranked South Africa are hoping to spoil Indias party and come into the tournament full of confidence following a T20 series whitewash against England.The Proteas have never won the World Twenty20 but anything less than the final will be considered a failure for the Faf du Plessis-led side, who boast top runscorers AB De Villiers and Hashim Amla and legspinner Imran Tahir.Defending champions Sri Lanka are a shadow of the side that won in Bangladesh two years ago and have struggled to come to terms with the void left by legends Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene.The West Indies tilt at a second title, have been hit by injury, withdrawals and a bitter pay dispute with squad members arguing with the countrys board over fees to play in the tournament.Experienced batsman Darren Bravo, all-rounder Kieron Pollard and off-spinner Sunil Narine are all out but it would be unwise to write off the third-ranked Windies, especially when they boast the big-hitting Chris Gayle.The preliminary round starts on Tuesday with Afghanistan and Bangladesh favourites to join the big eight teams in the Super-10 group stage.In Tuesdays opening matches, Hong Kong take on Zimbabwe and Afghanistan play Scotland.",03-08-2016,Hosts with the most India eye World T20 cr,cricket,NEW DELHI,Kumar;Sunil;Mahela;Darren;Pollard;Ravichandran;Chris;Sunil Narine;Singh;Amla;Virat;Hashim Amla;Mahendra Singh;Kumar Sangakkara;Mohammad Amir;Mahendra;Narine;Amir;Sangakkara;Imran;Darren Bravo;Ravichandran Ashwin;Mohammad;Jayawardene.The;Virat Kohli;Kohli;Mahela Jayawardene.The;Kieron Pollard;Ashwin;Kieron;Hashim;Bravo,,AB De Villiers;International Cricket Council;Windies;ICC;Faf

"A jury on Monday found a Nashville hotel liable for a nude video of sportscaster Erin Andrews that went viral and awarded her $55 million in damages to be paid by the hotel and the man who shot the video.Andrews sued the Nashville Marriott at Vanderbilt University over a 2008 video of her that was taken by a stalker in an adjoining room and posted on the Internet in 2009. Andrews, a Fox sportscaster who used to work for ESPN, had sought $75 million in damages.""We're disappointed with the outcome,"" defense attorney Marc Dedman told reporters. He said he would consult with his clients - the hotel owners and its former operators - on whether they would appeal.Jurors began deliberating on Monday morning after the two-week trial concluded on Friday.""I've been honored by all the support from victims around the world. Their outreach has helped me be able to stand up and hold accountable those whose job it is to protect everyone's safety, security and privacy,"" Andrews said in a brief statement on her Twitter feed.Andrews testified for two days during the trial, saying that since the video was seen by millions of people, she experienced serious mental injury, including depression, crying spells and sleeplessness.Her lawyers argued that the hotel was negligent and could have prevented the incident.The video was taken by Michael David Barrett, who pleaded guilty in 2009 to stalking Andrews and making the video. He was sentenced to 30 months in prison.Barrett asked the hotel to put him in a room next to Andrews' after an employee confirmed to him that she was staying there on a certain date. He rigged a peep hole to shoot the video of Andrews while she was changing.Lawyers for the hotel argued that the responsibility was solely Barrett's and there was no way the hotel could have foreseen what he did.The parties who were found liable were West End Hotel Partners, the investment group that owned the Nashville Marriott, and the operating company of the hotel at the time, Windsor Capital Group. Marriott International was originally named in Andrews' lawsuit, but the judge removed it.The jury found that the hotel is liable for 49 percent of the $55 million in damages, or $26.95 million, while Barrett is liable for 51 percent of the damages, equivalent to $28.05 million.",03-08-2016,Jury finds hotel liable in Erin Andrews stalker video ,misc,,Marc;Michael David Barrett;Andrews;Marc Dedman;Fox;Dedman;Erin;Michael;David;Barrett;Erin Andrews,Erin Andrews,Marriott International;Windsor Capital Group;Vanderbilt University;ESPN;Nashville Marriott
"LOS ANGELES: Russian tennis star Maria Sharapova, the highest-paid woman in sports, said on Monday that she failed a drug test at the Australian Open due to a substance she has been taking for 10 years for health issues.The 28-year-old Sharapova, a five-time grand slam champion, will be provisionally suspended starting March 12, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said.She is the seventh athlete in a month to test positive for meldonium, which is used to treat diabetes and low magnesium, and was only banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency as of Jan. 1.""I made a huge mistake. I let my fans down and I let the sport down,"" said Sharapova, a teenage tennis prodigy who became the third-youngest Wimbledon champion. ""I take full responsibility for it.""""I know that with this I face consequences and I don't want to end my career this way. I really hope that I will be given another chance to play this game,"" former world No.1 Sharapova told a news conference in a downtown Los Angeles hotel.The ITF's anti-doping program calls for a four-year suspension for a positive test, but that ban can be reduced in various circumstances, such as for first-time offences or if the player shows no significant fault or negligence. If a player bears no fault or negligence, there is no suspension.According to Forbes, she earned $29.5 million in 2015, mostly from endorsements.Sharapova said her family doctor had been giving her mildronate, which is also called meldonium, for 10 years after she frequently became sick, had irregular EKG results, a magnesium deficiency and a family history of diabetes.""It is very important for you to understand that for 10 years this medicine was not on WADA's banned list and I had been legally taking the medicine. But on January the first, the rules have changed and meldonium became a prohibited substance.""The World Anti-Doping Agency, or WADA, declined to comment until ITF issues a final decision.Meldonium is used to treat chest pain and heart attacks among other conditions, but some researchers have linked it to increased athletic performance and endurance. It is listed by WADA among its prohibited metabolic modulators, along with insulin, and some researchers say it can also help recovery.It is not approved in the United States but is available in Russia, Latvia and other countries in that region. Over the past month, Russian cyclist Eduard Vorganov, Russian figure skater Ekaterina Bobrova and Ethiopia-born athletes Endeshaw Negesse and Abeba Aregawi and Ukraine biathletes Olga Abramova and Artem Tyshchenko have all tested positive for meldonium.Sharapova is the most prominent tennis player to test positive for a banned substance in recent years.",03-08-2016,Tennis star Sharapova faces suspension after failing drug ,tennis,LOS ANGELES,Abeba;Eduard;Eduard Vorganov;Olga Abramova;Maria Sharapova;Tyshchenko;Abramova;Endeshaw;Aregawi;Sharapova;Bobrova;Artem Tyshchenko;Artem;Endeshaw Negesse;Negesse;Ekaterina Bobrova;Abeba Aregawi;Olga;Ekaterina;Vorganov;Maria,Sharapova;Maria Sharapova,World Anti-Doping Agency;ITF;WADA

"CAPE TOWN: South Africa staged a sensational comeback in defence of a below-par total to claim a first T20 series win over West Indies and sound a warning ahead of the World T20.South Africa's victory came less than three weeks after they beat England for the first time in a T20 and illustrated the progress the team has made since September 2014, when they were beaten 4-0 by England.West Indies, who have not lost a series in the same period of time, will be disappointed with their failure to complete a straightforward chase, especially as they were well on course.They had reached 81 for 3 in the 15th over and even though their captain Stafanie Taylor had been bowled around her legs by Dane van Niekerk, they had their other stalwart Deandra Dottin on hand.Dottin seemed to be striking the ball better than any of her team-mates but when she attempted a loft over long-on, she mistimed to spark a collapse. South Africa took four more wickets in the next 18 balls and then squeezed at the end to pull off a remarkable win.South Africa recovered from an early blow when Shamilia Connell had Trisha Chetty caught at slip and rebuilt cautiously through van Niekerk was joined and Mignon du Preez.The pair found the boundary just five times but rotated strike well to score at more than a run-a-ball and put on 48 for the second wicket. When van Niekerk was bowled as she tried to slog sweep Taylor over midwicket, and with the run-rate stagnating, du Preez took it on herself to try and force the pace. She managed only to gift a catch to short midwicket.Marizanne Kapp and Lizelle Lee also found it heavy going but with South Africa yet to reach 100 and only two overs left, they took some risks. Lee was the only batsman to clear the boundary and her efforts at the end gave South Africa something to defend but when West Indies knocked off the first 14 runs inside two overs, they would not have expected to be successful.Moseline Daniels had Kycia Knight trapped lbw to provide some early hope but that only brought Taylor to the crease. She tried to end matters quickly with her aggressive approach and when she was bowled, Dottin took over.

Bukhari was run-out in the last over, and neither Seelaar nor Logan van Beek could find the boundaries.Ultimately, Tamim Iqbal's unbeaten 83, as the rest of the Bangladesh batting line-up struggled, Mashrafe Mortaza's boundary-less last three overs and Taskin's accurate last over combined for Bangladesh's win.The game was in Netherlands' grasp when they needed 54 runs in the last five overs with seven wickets in hand.

"CALIFORNIA: While Maria Sharapovas fellow players were shocked by the Russians announcement that she failed a drug test at the Australian Open, most of them felt the ""huge mistake"" could have been avoided.World number three Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland described it as ""a very sad day for tennis"" but expressed the views of many by saying it was down to every player, via their doctor, to check whether prescribed medications were legal.Five-times grand slam champion Sharapova tested positive for meldonium, which some researchers have linked to increased athletic performance and endurance, after failing by her own admission to realise that it had been outlawed since Jan.1.""I dont check those emails,"" Radwanska told reporters on Wednesday about receiving notification of which substances and medications were on the banned list before the start of every year.""That is what my doctor is doing and my agent. ""I am scared because I know every pill can have something in it so when I am sick I am just taking aspirins 100 percent because I am always afraid that it is going to be something else.(To be safe) I had better play with the flu. ""Mens world number five Rafael Nadal pointed to Sharapovas negligence while also hoping that the Russian had made an innocent mistake.""Everybody can have mistakes,"" the Spanish left-hander said at Indian Wells. ""I want to believe for sure that it is a mistake for Maria, she didnt want to do it. ""But it is obvious that it is negligence. The rules are like this.

""Its something which we all should know, what we are taking and what we are putting into the body.""Its a huge mistake unfortunately and she has taken responsibility for it. We see that they (doping authorities) are trying to have a clean sport.The system is working, they are doing a good job on that. ""Sharapova, who faces a ban of up to four years pending an investigation by the International Tennis Federation, has got vocal support from fellow Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova but other players have taken a less charitable view.Three-time grand slam champion Jennifer Capriati tweeted earlier this week: ""Im extremely angry and disappointed.I had to lose my career and never opted to cheat no matter what. I had to throw in the towel and suffer.""I didnt have the high priced team of drs that found a way for me to cheat and get around the system and wait for science to catch up.""In stark contrast, twice grand slam champion Kuznetsova tweeted on Wednesday: ""First of all, I want to say that Maria is a great athlete, and even this ""strange mistake"" will not be able to outshine all of what she has achieved in tennis.""And most importantly, none of us, especially me, have no rights to comment this story - not to criticize or evaluate Maria.Doping agency has to see this case, not others. ""Sharapova also has been backed by both world number ones, Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams.""I obviously wish her all the best,"" Djokovic told TMZ Sports. ""Ive known her for a long time and I feel for her for whats happening. I just hope she gets out of this stronger.

"NAGPUR: Scotland defeated Hong Kong under D/L method in the rain-affected match in the World Twenty20 first round group B here at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium Saturday night.Scotland had gone 20 matches in ICC global events - since the 1999 World Cup - without a win. The losing streak hung like Coleridge's albatross around their necks. They were desperate to shake it off.In their 21st match, against Hong Kong on an unexpectedly rainy night in Nagpur, they finally did it and exited the World T20 with an eight-wicket win, which was set up by a sharp bowling performance.The portents were clear right from the third ball of the match. Left-arm spinner Mark Watt gave generous flight as the ball gripped the cracked pitch and tested Jamie Atkinson with slow turn. Some balls turned like that, some skidded on, while others stopped on the batsmen.The trio of Watt, Con de Lange, and Matt Machan combined to send Hong Kong on a tail spin with figures of 12-0-66-4.Rain gave Hong Kong brief respite, and the contest was then reduced to a 10-over shootout, after which Scotland overhauled the revised target of 76 with ease.George Munsey kick-started the chase with a flurry of fours. By the time he holed out, Scotland had knocked off more than one fourth of their target. And by the sixth over Scotland had dashed past 50, with several of their players lining up by the edge of the boundary to celebrate.",03-12-2016,Scotland record first win at ICC global ev,cricket,NAGPUR,de;Watt;Con;Atkinson;Jamie Atkinson;Matt Machan;Munsey;Mark;Lange;Machan;Mark Watt;Con de Lange;Matt;Jamie;Coleridge,,

"MUMBAI: The World Twenty20 has provided a stage for Asian sides to flourish in its short history and host India's scintillating form leading up to the tournament will only fuel local hopes that the trend will continue.India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have won three out of the five stagings of the biennial tournament, while the 2010 final was the only one that did not feature a team from South Asia.Former players and pundits have been united in endorsing India, who won the 50-over World Cup at home in 2011, as favourites to add a second World Twenty20 title to their cabinet and given the side's run of form, it is hardly surprising.Mahendra Singh Dhoni's men have won 10 of the 11 Twenty20 contests they have played this year, including a 3-0 win in Australia, and have looked supremely balanced with their often-soft bowling attack also showing plenty of bite.The only worry for India's fanatical cricket following will be that the team have peaked too early and they will be desperately hoping that the law of averages catches up with them after the final at Kolkata's Eden Gardens on April 3.While India have enjoyed a relatively trouble-free build up to the tournament, it has been far from smooth sailing for fellow Asian contenders Pakistan and Sri Lanka.Pakistan, the 2009 champions, arguably have the most potent pace attack with left-arm fast bowler Mohammad Amir seamlessly integrating into the side after a five-year spot-fixing ban.But Shahid Afridi's men have had troubles with their top-order, prompting the selectors to twice tinker with the squad and a row over security leading to a venue change for the highly charged India match will not have helped matters.Defending champions Sri Lanka have failed to adequately replace retired batting stalwarts Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene after their 2014 World Twenty20 triumph and were forced to install Angelo Mathews as their new captain this week.The island nation have lost recent series against New Zealand, India and a woeful Asia Cup display led to the sacking of the entire selection panel.The team and their supporters will keep their fingers crossed on the fitness of pace spearhead Lasith Malinga, who relinquished the captaincy due to the slow recovery of his injured knee but insists he can still play a part.strong>AUSTRALIA'S T20 CONUNDRUM</strongAustralia will look to end their lack of success in the format and add the T20 title to their 50-over World Cup triumph on home soil last year, banking on their explosive batting line-up to make up for the lack of a potent spinner.They have not left anything to chance though, replacing Aaron Finch with test and one-day international skipper Steve Smith to lead the side, who have had a number of players plying their trade in the Indian Premier League (IPL) over the years.Another side hoping the experience of playing in the IPL will come in handy for their players will be South Africa, who once again will be determined to shed their 'chokers' tag at another global championship.AB de Villiers, believed by most to be the most destructive batsman in world cricket, has often entertained crowds in India during the IPL with his 360 degree batting and South Africa will hope the 32-year-old can end their wait for a World Cup title.strong>FEARLESS ENGLAND</strongJos Buttler, Alex Hales and Eoin Morgan will believe they can be match de Villiers' pyrotechnics for England but the 2010 champions' bowling attack appears short of experience.They also have a powerful striker in Ben Stokes and the dependable Joe Root with the willow but it is to be seen if the batting can gloss over their bowling shortcomings.Fellow contenders New Zealand may have a few psychological issues to resolve if they are to overcome their tendency to come up short on the big stage.Their preparations have been overshadowed by the recent death of former captain Martin Crowe while the retirement of Brendon McCullum has robbed them of an exceptional reader of the game with unbridled batting firepower.Darren Sammy will also have to inspire an understrength West Indies team, who just weeks ago were planning to boycott the tournament over a contractual dispute, if the 2012 champions are to stand any chance of winning a second title.",03-12-2016,India favoured to keep Asia on top in WC T20,cricket,MUMBAI,Mathews;Kumar;Hales;Angelo;Mahela;Lasith Malinga;Eoin;Angelo Mathews;Aaron;Ben Stokes;Morgan;Aaron Finch;Sammy;Singh;Steve Smith;Finch;McCullum;Malinga;Martin Crowe;Alex;Joe;Lasith;Kumar Sangakkara;Root;Mohammad Amir;Singh Dhoni;Smith;Dhoni;Amir;Sangakkara;Ben;Martin;Crowe;Joe Root;Brendon;Mohammad;Mahela Jayawardene;Brendon McCullum;Stokes;Steve;Eoin Morgan;Alex Hales;Shahid Afridi;Jayawardene;Afridi;Shahid,,IPL;Indian Premier League

That is not true and it never happened,"" Sharapova wrote.The 28-year-old Russian said she was making no excuses for not knowing about the ban that went into effect on Jan. 1, but said that after the first announcement, other notices were ""buried in newsletters, websites, or handouts.""""Again, no excuses, but its wrong to say I was warned five times,"" said Sharapova, who has said she took the drug for 10 years due to a family history of heart issues and diabetes.The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) added meldonium to their banned substance list after concluding that it improves blood flow and boosts exercise capacity.""Im proud of how I have played the game.

"DHARAMSALA: Netherland defeated Ireland in a dead rubber curtailed by rain to six-overs-a-side World Twenty qualifiers Group A match here on Sunday.Netherland after sent into bat, made 59 for five in six overs and later restricted Ireland to 47 for seven to win the match by 12 runs.There was snow on the mountain tops in Himachal Pradesh, if the drizzle had cleared the temperatures were plunging and Ireland felt the chill as once they were again tormented by the side in orange.The orange flash at deep midwicket that sparkled most brightly of all came 14 balls into Ireland's pursuit of 60 and belonged to Pieter Seelaar as he sprinted along the midwicket boundary before clinging to a slick diving catch.Paul van Meekeren banged the ball in back of a length, Kevin O'Brien's pull was middled, but the shot that might have broken the run chase (had it gone for six Ireland would have been 34 for 1 after 14 balls) was instead the harbinger of Ireland's growing despondency.As for van Meekeren, a return of 4 for 11 will awaken a little interest, one suspects, in English county cricket. By the time he began the final over, Ireland were still 20 short, and he demolished the stumps of Max Sorensen and George Dockrell to ensure there was no monkey business.Both sides were already eliminated but Netherlands were happy to get the consolation win..Only one Ireland player was allowed to bowl two overs and Dockrell's left-arm spin proved to be a wise choice, registering 3 for 7, and producing catching opportunities from three of his first five balls, two of which were taken. Seven dot balls out of 12, including an over in the Powerplay, was an astounding effort that might have brought victory.Dockrell found turn all the same as Netherlands' batsmen floundered against him. Tom Cooper slogged his third ball to mid-on, affording the opportunity to prey upon Roelof van der Merwe who was promoted to No. 3.It did not work out for van der Merwe. Twice, he slogged Dockrell's left-arm spin to the legside. Kevin O'Brien spilled the first - a slice to long-off and a grimace from O'Brien as he landed heavily, but van der Merwe's next attempt was entirely bungled and he fell off the cue end at short third man.The coup de grace came in Dockrell's second over when his turn outdid Wesley Barresi as he came down the pitch, leaving Niall O'Brien with a simple stumping.Stephan Myburgh was dropped on 9 by Paul Stirling at deep midwicket but was still restrict to 27 from 18 balls. When he was run out against the penultimate ball, the damage had been limited. Dockrell bowled only one ball at him - the first ball of his spell - and got away with a leg bye off his waist.Stirling addressed Ireland's chase when he twice walked across his stumps in Tim van der Gugten's first over to flick him over fine leg for six. But Seelaar's thrilling intervention changed the complexion of the game and Stirling fell to the next ball, his ramp shot was collected at third man.At 28.3 off 2.3, Ireland had opportunity even in a six-over game for a settling period, but their plight worsened when Gary Wilson and Stuart Poynter departed against van der Merwe within three balls - Wilson falling to a reverse sweep, Poynton skying a rustic slog.With 25 needed from two, and only five wickets remaining, Netherlands were suddenly favourites. A fine penultimate over from Mudassar Bukhari meant 20 were needed off the last.

"NAGPUR: New Zealand are bracing for a trial by spin when they open their World Twenty20 campaign against hosts India on Tuesday, skipper Kane Williamson said on the eve of their Super 10 fixture.The Indian team have been widely touted as firm favourites to win the biennial event due to their knowledge about the conditions at home and a strong run of form in the buildup to the tournament.New Zealand, though, have defeated India in all their previous four meetings in the shortest format of the game but their progress was somewhat thwarted against England's spinners on Saturday in their warm-up match.""We certainly are expecting spin to pay a big part in this tournament,"" Williamson told reporters on Monday, adding their past record against India would have no bearing on the match.""I suppose judging by the warm-up games in Mumbai, they had a bit for the seamers and it swung a little bit.""They were very good surfaces but from what cricket we have seen here in Nagpur, spin looks likely to play a big part. It's important that we adjust our gameplan accordingly.""Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin will lead India's slow bowling attack along with Ravindra Jadeja while part-timer Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina are also expected to chip in.New Zealand arrived at the tournament after a preparatory camp in Dubai, having played a two-test home series against Australia, during which former captain Brendon McCullum retired from international cricket.Williamson was confident there would not be any problems making the switch to the 20-over format.""We go into the match tomorrow with a clean slate. India is a strong side and Twenty20 cricket is fickle in nature,"" Williamson said.India, who won the 50-over World Cup at home in 2011, defeated Australia and Sri Lanka in bilateral series before winning the Asia Cup in Bangladesh, a run that saw them win 10 of their last 11 T20 matches.Batting stalwart Virat Kohli was confident the team can handle the burden of expectations.""At home we expect that, we're prepared for that,"" Kohli said. ""The skill required is how you manage yourself off the field, because on the field is probably the safest and quietest for you, especially in your home country.""The field is where you face the least pressure in big tournaments like this.""We're taking some good momentum into the World Cup.

"CHENNAI: A three-wicket haul from off-spinner Anisa Mohammed guided West Indies Women to a narrow four-run victory against Pakistan Women in Chennai.Chasing a seemingly small target of 104, Pakistan were dealt a serious blow early in their innings when the opener Javeria Khan was struck below her ear in the first over off a bouncer from Shamilia Connell. Javeria was immediately stretchered off the field and taken to a nearby hospital. Javeria underwent a CT scan, and is understood to now be conscious.Sidra Ameen and Bismah Maroof steadied the innings with a patient 40-run stand, but three quick blows from Mohammed swung the contest decisively West Indies way. First, Mohammed removed Ameed in the ninth over before proceeding to dismiss both Aliya Riyaz and Maroof in the 11th. It left Pakistan needing 60 off the last 56 balls, but the momentum was in West Indies' hands. Muneeba Ali (15), Sana Mir (18) and Asmavia Iqbal (19) all chipped in with handy knocks to keep Pakistan in sight of the target, but their slow run-rate left the team needing 12 off the final over, bowled by Deandra Dottin.Dottin conceded three off the first ball, but Pakistan failed to find the boundaries - the team managed just five in their entire innings - as West Indies hung on to open their account.

"South Africa fast bowler Dale Steyn has sounded a warning to batsmen at the World Twenty20 in India as he prepares to get his sides campaign off to a positive start against England in Mumbai on Friday.Steyn recently returned to the South Africa side after an injury-plagued season that he says has only increase his resolve to help his side to an elusive major one-day trophy.Following a 2-0 home Twenty20 series victory over England last month, the South Africans are brimming with confidence.I dont want to say that we have the upper hand but we have beaten them (England) in the shorter format and they do know it. Im fit and strong to play, Steyn told reporters in Mumbai on Wednesday.Steyn, who returned to action this month against Australia after groin and shoulder problems, has seen an improvement in South Africas limited-overs bowling attack which also includes seamers Kagiso Rabada, Kyle Abbott and Chris Morris.When I walked into the side for the Australia series I could see the guys were glowing with confidence, Steyn said.I was watching guys who normally sit on the side lines like Kyle Abbott landing their yorkers and slower balls.It was great to be out of the side because when I walked back in I realised how much I had missed it and how much these guys have grown as a team, even in that two month gap.South Africa play their opening two World Twenty20 matches against England and Afghanistan in the seam-friendly conditions of the Wankhede Stadium in MumbaiThey then take on West Indies at the VCA Stadium in Nagpur, which produced a rank turner in the game between India and New Zealand on Tuesday.Ive always said that I can bowl on any track, Steyn said.I prefer the wickets that are slower and turning. The ball stops and makes it tough for batsmen to hit you out of the ground, especially at a ground like Nagpur which is a big ground.As a seamer I back myself. I can bowl fast cutters, its difficult to hit the ball out of the ground when its coming at 140 or 145 and is gripping and stopping.",3/17/2016,Bullish Steyn ready to lead S Africa World Twenty20 bid,cricket,South Africa,Chris Morris.When;Morris.When;Kyle;Dale Steyn;Abbott;Kyle Abbott;Dale;Kagiso;Chris;Kagiso Rabada;Rabada;Steyn,Bullish Steyn,
"India's cricket team is undoubtedly, indisputably, unarguably, and by a massive distance, better than Pakistan's cricket team. At football.It was probably the only definitive bit of knowledge anyone could have gleaned from watching the two teams' training sessions on the eve of their World T20 clash at the Eden Gardens. If Saturday's big match involved goalposts and a large, inflated ball, India would lose no sleep over it.It is, instead, a cricket match. And not just any cricket match. It is the cricket match that causes a spike in the frequency of Venkatesh Prasad sightings on Indian television in the days leading up to it. And of Aamer Sohail and Kiran More and Javed Miandad and Ajay Jadeja and Waqar Younis and Joginder Sharma and Misbah-ul-Haq.It is an India-Pakistan clash at a World tournament, and it will come with the inevitable trappings. Famous people will sing national anthems. Massive names will be present among the massive numbers in attendance. Sachin Tendulkar will be there. So will Imran Khan. And Sunil Gavaskar. And Wasim Akram. And Kapil Dev. And Inzamam-ul-Haq.In the middle of all this, India and Pakistan, the cricket teams, will try and tune out the constant swirl of India-Pakistan.R Ashwin reinforced this during his pre-match conference on Friday, in a packed and insufficiently air-conditioned media room that evoked the pressure cooker clich.""This rivalry is huge,"" he said. ""It's very hard to put a finger [on it] and say how huge it is. It's probably bigger than the Ashes is. As far as the Indians go and the Pakistanis go, I don't think they watch this as a game of cricket. It's more of a border rivalry, they want to get one up on each other.""So there is much more to this game rather than the game itself taking centrestage. As far as people are concerned, they put their emotions into it. For the players it's about trying to keep the emotions aside and playing the game the best we can.""It is something India have invariably managed to do against Pakistan at World events. In six World Cup meetings and four in the World T20, they have never lost. It's the sort of record that can put pressure on both sides, but on this occasion India are under more of it, given that they are playing at home, and given that they were beaten soundly by New Zealand in their first game and therefore have to win this one. Over recent years, Pakistan have usually been underdogs going into matches against India, and on this occasion have the cushion of a big win in their opening game against Bangladesh.""History can change, too,"" Waqar Younis, Pakistan's head coach, said. ""We are confident, a little more this time because [India] can go out of the tournament also. They will be under a lot of pressure. We have to take it positively. We have won the last match, so there are lots of things going in our favour, hopefully. Yes, there is no doubt that our history hasn't been so good but history can always be changed.""In all the previous games, the pressure was on Pakistani team. This is the first time that the pressure is more on India - not arising from victory or defeat at the hands of Pakistan but because this is a very big tournament. I have been a cricketer all my years and it is impossible that India won't be feeling the pressure. I am sure they will be feeling the pressure and we are going to take advantage of that.""India arrived in Kolkata on Wednesday night, but only had an optional training session - which only Suresh Raina, Ajinkya Rahane and Pawan Negi attended - on Thursday. Their first full session ahead of the match was on its eve. Ashwin said the light schedule was followed to allow the players to relax after the loss to New Zealand, and not put themselves under too much pressure.""I think it was more about trying and relaxing,"" he said. ""It had nothing to do with who we are playing, what game we are playing and all that. We have been on the road for the last three months and we thought it's time now to sit in the hotel room and revisit what we did in the last game. The best thing that we can do is to think for ourselves than sitting together and practising.""What happens after a game like that is we tend to go into nervous practice, try and overdo everything, and eventually end up going into the match a little more tired than we actually should be. That's the idea behind it.""India's practice session on Friday reflected this mindset, with the bowlers hardly taxing themselves and only the middle-order trio of Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni and Hardik Pandya spending any real length of time batting. Pakistan - after their unconvincing footballing warm-up - had a more traditional nets session, with the fast bowlers coming off their full run-ups and sending down a relatively large quota of deliveries.Two training philosophies, neither definitely better or worse than the other, both geared to the same end: to keep minds focused on bat and ball, to tune out the crowds and the last-minute venue changes and the razzmatazz of the build-up. As Virat Kohli said before the start of the tournament, ""On the field is the safest and quietest place for you"". And until they actually get on the field, the match will live a parallel existence that has little to do with the actual cricket. It might as well be a football game where Mohammad Irfan and a magically young-again Venkatesh Prasad are goalkeepers in a penalty shootout.",3/18/2016,India Pakistan look to tune out India Pakistan hy,cricket,India,Prasad;Suresh;Jadeja;Hardik;Sunil;Miandad;Younis;Irfan;Kapil;Ajinkya;Suresh Raina;Aamer Sohail;Raina;Javed;Venkatesh Prasad;Sachin;Virat;Pawan Negi;Pawan;Yuvraj;Dhoni;Ajinkya Rahane;Virat Kohli;Kohli;Gavaskar;Ashwin;Sohail;Imran Khan;Waqar Younis;Tendulkar;Pandya;Joginder;Joginder Sharma;Khan;Rahane;Waqar;Sunil Gavaskar;Akram;Misbah-ul-Haq;Hardik Pandya;Javed Miandad;Wasim;Singh;Aamer;Negi;Ajay;Mohammad Irfan;Ajay Jadeja;Sachin Tendulkar;Imran;Mohammad;Wasim Akram;Sharma;Kapil Dev;Dev;Inzamam-ul-Haq;Yuvraj Singh;Venkatesh,,
"NAGPUR: Australia began their title defence with a six-wicket win against South Africa at the VCA Stadium in Nagpur. It was vice-captain Alex Blackwell and captain Meg Lanning who led the way to chase down 103 easily in the end, after they were reduced to 9 for 3 in the fourth over.South Africa had an excellent launch pad at 69 without loss in 12 overs after opting to bat. Then they fell into a crater courtesy rush of blood, indecision against spin and a number of misguided strokes to huff and puff to 102 for 6. As hard as they tried, defending it was never going to be easy against the masters of the big occasion who are gunning for their fourth successive title.Eventually, the batting meltdown played a big part in the result, as Lanning and Blackwell allayed fears with an unbroken 52-run fifth-wicket stand off just 38 balls to see Australia home with nine balls to spare.South Africa showed they were up for a fight as Dane van Niekerk did the early running by making 45 in a 72-run opening stand with Trisha Chetty, before Australia strangulated them.While Ellyse Perry hustled the batsmen with pace, Lauren Cheatle's canny variations resulted in South Africa's middle order having to manufacture strokes that didn't connect. Chetty's scratchy 34 eventually helped them cross the 100-run mark.Australia's thoughts of the chase being a walk in the park were firmly put on the backburner. Alyssa Healy walked across to flick, only to find her leg stump flattened to give the fired-up Shabnim Ismail an early sniff. Perry bottom-edged a cut to the wicketkeeper, while Ellyse Villani chopped on to leave Australia in tatters before they could reach double figures.Lanning's illness that kept her off the field for most parts of South Africa's innings meant she could come in either after 30 minutes or the fall of the fifth wicket. But the conclusion of Ismail's opening burst took with it the sting in their attack as Blackwell and Jess Jonassen added 44 for the fourth wicket. When Jonassen stepped out to be stumped, the game was back in the balance as Australia slipped to 53 for 4, needing 50 off 47 balls.Lanning struggled to run as she helped herself to three fours to bring the equation down to 23 off the last four overs. Once within striking distance, the feared white-ball striker in her surfaced as she hit Ismail for two fierce square cuts, to convert a tricky chase into a cruise.",3/18/2016,Australia women record easy win over South Africa ,cricket,NAGPUR,Dane van Niekerk;Villani;Chetty;Ellyse;Shabnim Ismail;Blackwell;Ellyse Villani;Lanning;Jess Jonassen;Jonassen;Trisha;Perry;Healy;Ellyse Perry;Ismail;Jess;Cheatle;Shabnim;Alex;van;Lauren Cheatle;Lauren;Alyssa;Niekerk;Alyssa Healy;Meg;Meg Lanning;Alex Blackwell;Trisha Chetty;Dane,,

"ISLAMABAD: Former cricket stars on Friday pinned hopes on skipper Shahid Afridi to repeat his all-round skills for the second time when Pakistan take on traditional rivals India in the eagerly awaited clash of the World Twenty20 as the sun sets on the lush green Eden Gardens of Kolkata.The former cricket greats believed the flamboyant all rounder Shahid Afridi could play a key role in national teams win against their arch foes.Afridi, who has been under fire after Pakistan s poor performance in the Asia Cup T20, played superbly both with the bat and ball in national teams win against Bangladesh in their opening match of ongoing T20 World Cup on Wednesday.Batting legend Javed Miandad said he wants Afridi to repeat his heroics of Bangladesh match when time comes for Saturdays encounter.Afridi has to bat up in the order. He must get maximum over s. He can be a terror, Miandad said.The former cricket great also praised Kolkata crowd, stating Kolkata has only sports loving people.They are passionate.

So psychologically they will have an edge over Indians as they suffered defeat in their first match against New Zealand, Wasim said.He also asked Pakistan team to adopt an attacking strategy against Indians. If Pakistan manage to get a couple of wickets in the power play session, they will be in a position to push India to the back foot, the former captain said.Former Test Captain Aamir Sohail says bowlers would have to work hard in the high profile World Twenty20 encounter.If India wins the toss and bats first, our bowlers will have to take early wickets in order to restrict the Indian batsmen to a low total.But if our batsmen are put to bat first, then they will have to take the responsibility and show some real performance like they did in the match against Bangladesh, said he.Sohail said: In case India prepares a flat pitch, Pakistan will have an edge over the arch rivals.But if they prepare a turning pitch, then India will have an upper handTest Skipper Misbah ul Haq said Pakistan could win the WorldTwenty20, if Shahid Afridi performs consistently in the whole tournament.Afridi needs to fire constantly if Pakistan wants to salvage a chance of clinching the title once again.If Afridi keeps going like this, Pakistan can win the World T20, he said.",3/18/2016,Former greats pin high hopes on Shahid Afridi,cricket,ISLAMABAD,Miandad;Misbah;Akram;Javed Miandad;Aamir;ul;he.Sohail;Wasim;Javed;Misbah ul Haq;Wasim Akram;Aamir Sohail;Sohail;Haq;Shahid Afridi;Afridi;Shahid,Shahid Afridi,Indians
"MOHALI: Suzie Bates' swift 60-ball 82 and her 104-run partnership with Sophie Devine for the second wicket set the base for New Zealand Women's massive 93-run win over Ireland Women in the World T20 match in Mohali.New Zealand got off to a blistering start after opting to bat, as opener Rachel Priest struck three fours in the first over before falling to medium-pacer Amy Kenealy in the second over.The wicket brought Bates and Devine together at the crease, and the pair built on the early momentum in their century stand. By the end of the Powerplay, New Zealand were 48 for one and except for a couple of quiet overs, the pair found the boundary with ease.Devine fell in the 15th over to Isobel Joyce, after a 34-ball 47, and Bates then propelled the score past 150.The New Zealand captain struck two successive sixes off Kim Garth in the penultimate over before falling for 82; her knock also included seven fours.She became the fourth player to score more than 2000 runs in women's T20I cricket and is second on the list of highest run-getters with 2063 runs, ahead of Sarah Taylor and Stafanie Taylor.Ireland's chase simply failed to get off the blocks. They lost two wickets within the first four overs for a score of 16 and by the tenth over had reached only 34 for 3.The required run rate was already more than 14 by that stage and it was only Joyce who showed some resistance with a 33-ball 28, the top score in an Ireland innings that eventually petered out to 84 for 5.Offspinner Leigh Kasperek had economical returns of 1-10 in her four overs while legspinner Erin Bermingham took 2 for 17.",3/18/2016,New Zealand crush Ireland in Womens World T20,cricket,MOHALI,Erin Bermingham;Stafanie;Leigh Kasperek;Leigh;Joyce;Sarah Taylor;Erin;Rachel Priest;Sarah;Stafanie Taylor.Ireland;Kenealy;Devine;Kim Garth;Suzie;Isobel;Sophie;Priest;Taylor;Rachel;Taylor.Ireland;Bates;Amy;Kasperek;Kim;Isobel Joyce;Amy Kenealy;Bermingham;Suzie Bates;Garth;Sophie Devine,,

"DHARAMSALA: New Zealand held their nerve to edge out Australia by eight runs in a tense World Twenty20 Group Two match on Friday and move closer to a place in the semi-finals.On a high after beating hosts India in their opening game, New Zealand posted a modest 142-8 before defending the total with disciplined bowling and tight fielding against their trans-Tasman rivals.Australia came into the tournament with an embarrassment of top-order riches and decided to open with Usman Khawaja and Shane Watson.The decision meant no place for Aaron Finch, who was captain of the side barely six weeks ago and is the top-ranked batsman in this format of the game.Khawaja (38) added 44 runs with Shane Watson (13) before Australia suffered a collapse to slump to 66-4 at the halfway mark of their innings.Glenn Maxwell (22) and Mitchell Marsh (24) tried their best but Australia kept losing wickets at regular intervals and needed 19 runs off the final over sent down by Corey Anderson.Anderson dismissed James Faulkner with the first ball to dash Australia's slender hopes of a narrow win as New Zealand rose to the top of the group table.Mitchell McClenaghan justified his selection at the cost of off-spinner Nathan McCullum, claiming figures of 3-17.Earlier, Martin Guptill (39) gave New Zealand a flying start in a 61-run opening stand with skipper Kane Williamson (24) who decided to bat first on a dry track at the picturesque stadium in the north Indian hill station.Guptill greeted Aston Agar by hitting his first two balls out of the ground and a third six off the final ball of the over but Maxwell did an excellent job taking a catch in the deep to send back the dangerous Guptill, then dismissing Williamson with his second delivery and sending back Anderson in his next over.Later, he took another catch to dismiss Luke Ronchi and fired in a bullet throw to run out Mitchell Santner.Grant Elliot struck a quickfire 27 down the order but New Zealand managed only 84 runs in the last 14 overs.<br/> ",3/18/2016,New Zealand record dramatic win over Aussi,cricket,DHARAMSALA,Shane;Mitchell Marsh;Usman Khawaja;Aston;Watson;Maxwell;Kane Williamson;Elliot;Corey Anderson.Anderson;Watson.The;Santner.Grant;Kane;Aaron;Williamson;Nathan;Aaron Finch;Mitchell;Shane Watson;Finch;Faulkner;McCullum;Anderson.Anderson;Aston Agar;Nathan McCullum;James;Luke;Agar;Mitchell Santner.Grant Elliot;Martin;McClenaghan;Anderson;Ronchi;Martin Guptill;Guptill;Marsh;James Faulkner;Luke Ronchi;Khawaja;Corey;Usman;Shane Watson.The,,

"ZURICH: Football's ruling body FIFA said it paid disgraced former president Sepp Blatter 3.63 million Swiss francs ($3.8 million) last year, publishing his salary for the first time under new governance regulations.FIFA also announced it lost $122 million in 2015, its first deficit since 2002, attributing that mainly to the costs of battling the worst graft scandal in its history.In particular, FIFA's legal fees rose from $31.29 million in 2014 to $61.49 million while its reserves dropped from $1.52 billion to $1.34 billion.""The unprecedented events that occurred in 2015 have impacted upon FIFA's financial results, however the organisation's healthy reserves have allowed it to weather the storm,"" the Swiss-based federation said in a statement.Several dozen officials, including former members of FIFA's executive committee, have been indicted in the United States while Blatter has been banned for six years by the ruling body's ethics committee.FIFA said Blatter's former secretary general Jerome Valcke, banned for 12 years, was paid 2.12 million Swiss francs last year. The aggregate remuneration of key management personnel was $27.9 million.Blatter had been FIFA president since 1998 and his salary had long been the subject of speculation. It was finally published on Thursday under new rules which were passed in February in an attempt to make FIFA more transparent.FIFA said it calculated Blatter and Valcke's payments on the advice of an ""independent, external company that specialises in HR and compensation issues.""Despite the troubles, FIFA said it had revised its projected revenue for the 2015-2018 cycle upwards from $5 billion to $5.65 billion, with projected investments amounting to $5.55 billion.Last year, Valcke, while still secretary general, admitted that FIFA was having trouble in negotiating new sponsorship deals because of its battered reputation.New FIFA president Gianni Infantino, whose salary has not been revealed, made ambitious promises during his election campaign to increase spending on football development around the world.""With the recently approved reforms, I believe that we have turned a corner and that FIFA is poised to emerge stronger than ever,"" said Infantino.""During my presidency, I pledge to make this happen and to lead FIFA into a brighter and more sustainable future so that we can all return our full focus to football.""""We saw in 2015 that FIFA's competitions  such as the FIFA Women's World Cup  remain an incredible opportunity for us to promote the game and to raise the funds we need to fulfil our core mission of football development.""During the electoral campaign, two of Infantino's rivals said that his plans were not financially viable and could wipe out FIFA's reserves.Revenue from World Cup sponsors dropped from $131 million to $44.5 million in 2015 after contracts with Johnson &amp; Johnson, Castrol and Continental expired at the end of 2014.However, revenue from FIFA's top tier partners increased from $177.1 million to $180 million.FIFA, which said it employed an average of 582 people throughout 2015, spent $92.1 million on personnel, compared to $115.28 million the year before.",3/18/2016,FIFA paid Blatter 376 million in 2015,football,ZURICH,Sepp Blatter;Gianni Infantino;Infantino;Blatter;Sepp;committee.FIFA;Valcke;Gianni;Jerome;Jerome Valcke,Blatter;Sepp Blatter,Castrol;Johnson &amp; Johnson;Continental;FIFA

"MUMBAI: South Africa survived a spirited Afghanistan chase to defend a 200-plus score and get their World Twenty20 campaign back on track.Chris Morris and Imran Tahir squeezed through the middle period to ensure AB de Villiers' quickfire 64 was not in vain, he took 29 runs off Rashid Khan, which ended up being the major difference between the two sides.In the end, South Africa will be relieved that they were able to defend their total, but disappointed that the margin of victory was not bigger. They tightened up on their discipline in the field but still gave away more extras than their opposition - six wides compared to two from Afghanistan - and did not show the kind of killer instinct that they will need later in the tournament.They also suffered an injury concern. JP Duminy left the field four balls into Afghanistan's chase with a hamstring strain and was unable to take any further part in the match. Duminy has only just found form again and his availability will be important for the rest of the World T20.Quinton de Kock picked up from where he left off two days ago and dominated the opening passages of play. Hashim Amla may have wanted to catch up but after one four, gifted a catch to Asghar Stanikzai at mid-off.South Africa held de Villiers back and sent in Faf du Plessis at No.3. The strategy worked. Du Plessis took on the spin from Mohammad Nabi while de Kock continued to attack in the Powerplay. South Africa finished it on 66 for 1 and 60 of those runs came in boundaries.When the fielding restrictions were lifted, Rashid put the brakes on with the first boundary-less over of the innings, but du Plessis did not want things to slow down too much. He picked up the pace before being run-out and de Villiers was soon at the crease.Afghanistan were not under threat immediately while de Villiers settled in and de Kock nicked off. After conceding just 19 runs in three overs after the halfway stage of the South African innings, Afghanistan might have been hopeful of pulling South Africa even further back. But Duminy and de Villiers were wise to the need to accelerate and began to push for runs.It was up to David Miller to take them to 200 after de Villiers was dismissed. Twenty runs off the final over ensured South Africa had a second straight 200-plus score.However, Mohammad Shahzad threatened to gun down that total all by himself. He began fearlessly against Kagiso Rabada and Kyle Abbott and plundered 32 runs off the first two overs. His partner Noor Ali Zadran did not face a ball until the third over and then, it was only to return the strike to Shahzad.Morris was brought on in the fourth over and showed improvement from previous performances. He started by holding his length back but then steamed in with a delivery just under 150kph - full and straightening - which splayed Shahzad's stumps.Asghar Stanikzai and was caught behind in Morris' next over but Gulbadin Naib kept Afghanistan in it and targeted David Wiese, South Africa's replacement for Steyn. Afghanistan reached 10 overs on 103 for 2, 11 runs ahead of where South Africa were at the same stage. Then, Gulbadin was caught behind, Noor Ali was stumped, and Afghanistan were wobbling, still needing 100 runs off eight overs. Their chase was over then and South Africa had the chance to drill home an advantage.Instead, they allowed Afghanistan to drag it out. Abbott and Morris got the yorker right more often than they did in previous matches and Rabada managed one at the end, but South Africa will not feel it was a complete performance by any means.

"Pakistan did all they could to get their World Twenty20 match against India moved to Kolkata, even threatening to withdraw, but poor selection and the hosts all-round superiority left them wishing they had not bothered to turn up at all.The most anticipated match of the tournament between the neighbours was shifted to Eden Gardens at the last moment over security concerns at the original venue at Dharamsala.Pakistan repeatedly emphasised Indias morale-sapping loss in the opener against New Zealand was an advantage for them and they were even more confident of breaking their jinx of losing every World Cup match between the bitter rivals.Their decision to play four fast bowlers against India reflected an approach more suited to the 1980s West Indies side and dropping spinner Imad Wasim at the expense of a paceman underlined their failure to read the surface.Asked to bat in the rain-shortened Group Two match, the 2009 champions were largely subdued once off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin got the new ball to turn viciously.Doubts seemed to creep into Pakistans minds regarding what would be a decent target to set India, who folded for 79 against the Kiwis on a turning track while chasing 127 in their opener, and the innings never gained momentum until the death overs.MEAGRE TOTAL""There are few areas we need to improve, specially our batting,"" said Shoaib Malik, who top-scored with a 26 for Pakistan.""Even though it was a tough pitch to bat on, I believe we could have set a higher target.""In the end, Pakistan could only manage a meagre 118 for five in their 18 overs, nowhere near enough without the bowling depth New Zealand could draw upon in Nagpur when their spinners picked up nine of 10 wickets to stun India.India did suffer a minor wobble though, slumping to 23-3 after Mohammad Sami dismissed Shikhar Dhawan and Suresh Raina in consecutive deliveries in the fifth over to silence the 60,000 crowd at Eden Gardens as well as the millions watching on TV.However, Indias batting mainstay Virat Kohli hit a prudent 55 not out to calm the nerves and showed why he is considered one of the worlds best.The right-hander, who averages almost 85 in T20s against Pakistan, was aided by the fact that he did not have to face too many deliveries from Mohammad Amir, whose opening spell of 1-3 ran shivers down Indias spines.The left-arm paceman was not brought back on by Shahid Afridi until India were nearing victory and the leg-spinning skipper, who lacks the guile to turn the ball effectively, was unable to stem the flow of runs himself.As the pressure lifted, India were easily able to maintain their utter dominance of Pakistan in World Cup events, adding a fifth World Twenty20 victory to the six triumphs in the 50-over format.",3/20/2016,Pakistan fail to show up as India revive campaig,cricket,Pakistan,Suresh;Imad;Shoaib Malik;Ravichandran;Mohammad Sami;Suresh Raina;Wasim;Imad Wasim;Raina;Shikhar Dhawan;Virat;Mohammad Amir;Amir;Ravichandran Ashwin;Sami;Mohammad;Shoaib;Malik;Virat Kohli;Shikhar;Kohli;Ashwin;Dhawan;Shahid Afridi;Afridi;Shahid,,Kiwis

"BENGALURU: Australia survived another middle-order collapse to beat Bangladesh by three wickets in the World Twenty20 Super 10 on Monday to get their campaign up and running.Both teams were looking to bounce back from losing their opening Group Two games, Australia skipper Steve Smith winning the toss and choosing to field.Smiths men picked up wickets at regular intervals to restrict Bangladesh to a modest 156 for five despite a late flurry by Mahmudullah who hit seven fours in an unbeaten 49.Leg-spinner Adam Zampa (3-23) and all-rounder Shane Watson (2-31) were the pick of the bowlers.Openers Usman Khawaja (58) and Watson (21) then got Australia off to a good start, sharing a stand of 62 in 44 deliveries before the latter was run out.Khawaja was bowled by Al-Amin Hossain in the 14th over having struck seven fours and a six in a 45-ball knock that gave Australia a solid platform, although they had the same sort of middle-order slump they suffered in the first game against New Zealand.Smith, out for six against the Kiwis, was bowled by Mustafizur Rahman for 14.David Warner (17) was next to fall and was soon followed by Mitchell Marsh (six).Glenn Maxwell then scored a brisk 26 before being stumped by Mushfiqur Rahim off left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan.All-rounder John Hastings, brought in by Australia for left-arm spinner Ashton Agar, was dropped on nought by Hossain and finally went for three when he was caught at mid-wicket by Soumya Sarkar.By then Australia needed five runs off the last two overs and James Faulkner and Peter Nevill saw them through to a far-from-convincing win that lifted them to third in the group behind New Zealand and Pakistan but ahead of India.Bangladesh, who are bottom, have a mountain to climb to reach the semi-finals.",3/21/2016,Khawaja guides Australia to three wicket wi,cricket,BENGALURU,Shane;Mitchell Marsh;Glenn Maxwell;Soumya Sarkar.By;John;Watson;Maxwell;Peter Nevill;Mustafizur Rahman;Shakib Al Hasan.All-rounder John Hastings;Al-Amin Hossain;Faulkner;Mushfiqur;David Warner;Smith;Sarkar.By;Nevill;Hossain;Adam;Mustafizur;Adam Zampa;Shakib;Rahman;Ashton Agar;David;James Faulkner;Usman;Usman Khawaja;Al;Ashton;Warner;Zampa;Mitchell;Shane Watson;Steve Smith;Glenn;Hasan.All-rounder;Mahmudullah;James;Agar;Hastings;Soumya;Al-Amin;Rahim;Steve;Marsh;Mushfiqur Rahim;Peter;Khawaja,Khawaja;Usman Khawaja,Kiwis

"MOHALI: Pakistan were finally out of the World Twenty20 after another dismal performance in their last group match here at the Punjab Cricket Association IS Bindra Stadium on Friday.Chasing an improbable target of 194, Pakistan were never really in control of the asking rate throughout the chase as they could make 172 for eight.Now, Australia, securing four points from three matches, have to beat India at the same venue on March 27 to get into the semi-finals.This was the third successive defeat for Pakistan after a 55-run win against Bangladesh.

Sarfraz Ahmed and Ahmed Shehzad were dismissed for two and one, respectively.Earlier, Australia lost three early wickets for 57 after captain Steven Smith won the toss and opted for batting.Usman Khawaja (21) and David Warner (9) were clean bowled by fast bowler Wahab Riaz while Aaron Finch (15) was bowled by left-arm spinner Imad Wasim.However, Smith along with Glenn Maxwell and later with Shane Watson lifted Australia to a huge total of 193 for four, their second highest against Pakistan in a T20 International, after 197-7 at Gros Islet in May 2010.Smith made an unbeaten 61off 43 balls with seven fours while Maxwell scored 30 off 18 balls with three fours and a six before Imad got him out.Both added 62 runs for the fourth wicket and then Smith added another 74 runs for an unbeaten fifth wicket stand with the soon-to-retire Shane Watson, who also remained not out on 44 from 21 balls after hitting three sixes and four boundaries.For Pakistan, Wahab and Imad claimed two wickets each while pacers Amir Khan, Mohamamd Sami and leg-spinner Afridi failed to get any wicket.

"AMSTERDAM: Johan Cruyff, one of football's greatest players and most influential and visionary coaches, died aged 68 on Thursday after a five-month battle with lung cancer.The death of the Dutchman, whose creative genius on the pitch and inventive brilliance as a coach changed the modern game, prompted an outpouring of tributes to a figure hailed as doing more than anyone to ""to make the beautiful game beautiful"".In his heyday in the early 1970s, Cruyff, slender, quick-witted and outrageously gifted, helped a generation of football fans across the world see the game in a different light.Unquestionably the best player in the world in that period, he was voted three times winner of the prestigious Ballon d'Or so that he is now often mentioned alongside the pair widely considered the finest to have played the game, Pele and Diego Maradona.Brazilian Pele said on Thursday: ""Johan Cruyff was a great player and coach. He leaves a very important legacy for our family of football. We have lost a great man.""Maradona said: ""We will never forget you, mate"" while another Argentine Lionel Messi, the world's best current player, added: ""Another legend has left us today.""Cruyff, who had announced last October that he was suffering from lung cancer, had said only last month that he was ""2-0 up in the first half"" of his battle against the disease.Poignantly, that turned out to be one of the last public statements made by the sage whose observations on the modern game were eagerly courted in global football, with his weekly column for De Telegraaf newspaper a must-read until the end.Cruyff died surrounded by his friends and family at his home in Barcelona, according to his official website.The news prompted eulogies from his home country with Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, saying: ""The whole world knew him and, through him, the world knew the Netherlands.""The Netherlands' international against France on Friday in Amsterdam will be halted for a minute-long silence after 14 minutes in tribute to Cruyff, who wore the number 14 in his playing days.In his adopted home of Barcelona, though, the loss was just as keenly felt with Cruyff having become an iconic figure in the Catalan city, where their current world-beating team, featuring Messi, still bears the hallmarks of his attacking invention.As Pep Guardiola, one of his successful and influential successors as Barcelona coach, said: ""He painted the chapel and Barcelona coaches since have merely restored or improved it.""",3/25/2016,World football mourns death of Dutch master Cruyff,football,AMSTERDAM,Mark;Lionel;Johan;Ballon;Rutte;Pep Guardiola;Lionel Messi;Johan Cruyff;Cruyff;Maradona;Diego;Diego Maradona.Brazilian Pele;Pele;Mark Rutte;Maradona.Brazilian;Pep;Guardiola;Messi,Cruyff;Johan Cruyff,Barcelona;De Telegraaf

With this result, Australia join New Zealand in the semi-finals from Group A.South Africa's openers - Trisha Chetty and Dane van Niekerk - added 21 after being inserted, but the New Zealand bowlers kept chipping away thereafter.Marizanne Kapp anchored the middle overs with a steady 22, but substantial partnerships were hard to come by.Just as South Africa were looking for a late surge, they lost their five wickets for nine runs in the space of 11 balls, with Sophie Devine taking three of them in the penultimate over of the innings.Leigh Kasperek contributed with three wickets to become the tournament's highest wicket-taker, with nine scalps.Suzie Bates, the competition's leading run-scorer, and her opening partner Rachel Priest, the third highest on the run charts, added 57 in just 50 balls to effectively kill the game. Both fell within the space of two overs, though, and Kapp trapped Sara McGlashan soon after, but it was too late.Devine provided the finishing touches with a 17-ball 27, an innings that featured three fours and a six.",3/26/2016,NZealand knock SAfrica out of Womens World T20,cricket,BANGALORE,Dane van Niekerk;van;Sophie;Chetty;Priest;Niekerk;Rachel;Bates;Kasperek;Trisha;Trisha Chetty;Dane;Rachel Priest;McGlashan;Kapp;Sara;Devine;Sophie Devine;Sara McGlashan,,

Dasun Shanaka joined him and both took the score to 155 but two wickets fell in the 19th over - Shanaka and then Herath were gone.In the final over, they needed 15 runs to win but Ben Stokes bowled intelligently to concede only four runs and England emerged victorious in the end.Mathews remained not out on 73.

"MOHALI: Not even the support of a festive home crowd and conditions they thrive could inspire India Women as they slumped to a three-run loss to West Indies Women in Mohali.The defeat brought the curtains down on India's disappointing World Twenty20 campaign.Jhulan Goswami, who bowled all of two overs on a slow surface, kept India alive with a few lusty blows that brought the equation down to 20 off the last two overs.Tension engulfed the PCA Stadium, but a crowd that was on tenterhooks roared in delight as the third ball of the penultimate over sailed over long-on to bring it down to 12 off nine balls.But her run-out off the next delivery, once again, meant the pendulum swung West Indies' way. Deandra Dottin, who ensured West Indies were in with a chance by making 45 off 40 balls in the team's total of 114 for 8, then showed immaculate death-bowling skills to leave India short-changed.Shikha Pandey, who carved a boundary over point to bring it down to five off three balls was run-out off the next delivery to effectively dash India's hopes.India landed the early punches and weakened West Indies to 26 for 3 as the contest was reduced to a battle of spin attacks.The hosts then switched off for a bit, only to see Stafanie Taylor and Dottin regain lost ground, and then lift West Indies with a fourth-wicket partnership of 77.The stand helped West Indies post a total of 114 for 8, challenging, but by no means impossible.",3/27/2016,West Indies knock India out of Womens World T20,cricket,MOHALI,Goswami;Shikha Pandey;Deandra Dottin;Pandey;Taylor;Stafanie Taylor;Stafanie;Dottin;Shikha;Deandra,,West Indies Women

"BANGALORE: Sri Lanka Women captain Chamari Atapattu willed and rallied her side to a 10-run victory over South Africa Women in Bangalore, in the last league match of the Women's World T20.Atapattu first stroked her maiden T20 fifty, which contained five fours and one six, even as her partners floundered. Atapattu then brought herself into the attack in the defence of 114 and her second over resulted in two wickets. She ran to her right from her follow through, collected a wristy push from Trisha Chetty and flung a throw to the keeper to catch Dane van Niekerk short for 24 off 31 balls. Three balls later, Atapattu pinned her opposite number Mignon du Preez plumb in front for a duck, a wicket the Sri Lanka captain identified as the ""turning point"" at the post match-presentation.Left-arm spinner Sugandika Kumari and left-arm pacer Udeshika Prabodhani backed Atapattu to squeeze South Africa's middle order. From 50 for 0, South Africa slumped to 102 for 7. Du Preez said: ""We had a good start and we lost it in the middle order. We have been struggling with it in the whole tournament. It was also poor execution from us. This is something we need to work on and come back stronger.""Prabodhani speared in full balls and defended 12 off the last over, including taking the wicket of Chloe Tryon for 11 off 10 balls. Though it was only a dead rubber, Sri Lanka toasted the win, and got into a huddle only after wicketkeeper-batsman Dilani Manodara had joined the side from the dug out.Manodara was pinged on the grille of the helmet when he missed a scoop off her first ball. She scratched around for 4 off 9 balls, before she was bowled by seamer Marcia Letsoalo. She was later sent to the hospital for a scan, and it was found that she had no major injuries.Sri Lanka's middle order folded as well and they managed only 34 for 4 in their last five overs. Atapattu, however, had lifted Sri Lanka with a bevy of muscled slog sweeps. She hit 52 off 49 balls before she was run out by Marizanna Kapp who was featuring in her 50th T20 international. She picked up two wickets and was complemented by legspinner Sunne Luus who also scalped two wickets.But Attapattu's act proved to be too much for South Africa.

"NEW DELHI: Indian great Sachin Tendulkar remains the gold standard of batting in the post-Bradman era but Virat Kohlis latest masterclass in Sundays World Twenty20 shootout against Australia has prompted comparisons with his famous compatriot.Not for the first time in the tournament, it took Kohlis masterly knock to get India across the line in a virtual quarter-final against the reigning 50-overs world champions.Kohli remained unbeaten after a sublime 82, burnishing his reputation as arguably the best chaser in limited-overs cricket with a knock that reminded many of Tendulkars 143 against Australia in a 1998 one-dayer at Sharjah dubbed ""desert storm"".Shane Warne was at the receiving end of Tendulkars wrath in that match and 18 years since the contest, the Australian spin great saw Tendulkars shadow in Kohlis latest knock.""Great knock by @imVkohli Reminded me of one of your many special innings buddy,"" Warne tweeted to his great rival Tendulkar after Kohli secured India a place in the semi-finals on Sunday.Kohli bejewelled his knock with two sixes and nine boundaries and sprinted tirelessly between wickets in a flawless display of limited overs batting under tremendous pressure.He middled every ball, timed his shots with surgical precision and found gaps with eerie regularity to stamp his class.""Of the modern players, Ive always thought that Brian Lara was the best placer of the ball,"" former Australia captain Ian Chappell said. ""I think I have got Brian in second spot now.LARAS PRAISEThe West Indian batting great was also bowled by what he saw and requested videos of Kohlis early days, hailing the Indian as the ""best timer of a cricket ball"" that he has seen.At 27, Kohli stands on the brink of batting greatness with 36 international centuries against his name and averages of 44 in tests, 51 in one-dayers and 55 in Twenty20 matches.It has been a fascinating transformation of a Delhi cricketer perceived initially as yet another brash brat from the streets of a city long accused of inculcating aggression in its youth.Since Kohlis international debut in a one-dayer against Sri Lanka eight years ago, Mahendra Singh Dhoni has closely watched the tattoo-wearing, blunt-speaking, heart-on-his-sleeve youngster transform into a mature match-winner.Kohli hates the idea of an on-field confrontations that doesnt include him and Dhoni argued it suits the player who succeeded him as Indias test captain.""He will always be the same,"" Dhoni said after the victory in Mohali. ""He will be an aggressive character who will be ready to take on challenges and he will be aggressive on the field.""But he will also improve.

"NEW DELHI: England skipper Eoin Morgan would like to believe his team peaked at the right time at the ongoing World Twenty20 while New Zealand were slightly premature going into Wednesdays semi-final at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium.Kane Williamson and his Kiwi team mates have not put a foot wrong since landing in India, winning all four group matches without really breaking a sweat to qualify for the semi-finals as the tournaments only unbeaten team.For a side boasting an explosive batting order and a balanced attack to go with, Englands passage proved bumpier.Even before they could soak in the atmosphere, England were blown away by a Chris Gayle century in their tournament opener against West Indies in Mumbai.Joe Root sparked their recovery in the 230-run chase against South Africa but the narrow victory against Afghanistans modest resources exposed their frailties against spin bowling.They looked a significantly better side, however, in Saturdays 10-run win against champions Sri Lanka.Jos Buttler underlined his limited overs worth with a belligerent fifty, the pacemen made regular inroads, Ben Stokes delivered a tidy final over and the team held their nerve to secure a victory that seemed to tick most of the boxes.""In these tight tournaments you cant get through to the semis unless you are playing good cricket, and thats what we set out to do to give ourselves a chance,"" coach Trevor Bayliss said.""But its about peaking at the right time.I wouldnt say weve played the perfect game yet -- coaches are always looking for that absolutely perfect game, I dont think its ever been played -- but its what any team is striving to do.""Having played their last two games at Kotla, England would also hope to cash in on their familiarity with the venue in contrast to their opponents who were on a mini-tour of India playing each of their four group games at different venues.strong>KIWI ADAPTABILITY</strongThe trouble for England, however, is that New Zealand won all of them as the team, finalists in last years 50-over World Cup, strive to shed the tag of being crickets perennial bridesmaid.Leading from the front, Williamson has also displayed the tactical flexibility needed to win a tournament like this.New Zealand sprang a surprise in their tournament opener, picking three spinners in a gutsy gamble and went on to beat India, renowned for their batsmens comfort against the turning ball, in their own game.Williamson repeated the ploy against Bangladesh in their final group match for a similar result, his immaculate pitch assessment in stark contrast to most of the visiting captains who struggled to read the track as if it was in Braille.Left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner and leg-spinner Ish Sodhi have already forged a formidable partnership for the Kiwis, claiming 17 wickets between them in four matches.And if Williamson has noticed Englands struggle against Afghanistans slow bowlers, the Kiwi captain will be tempted to harness Nathan McCullums control and accuracy in a three-pronged spin attack.As demonstrated by Martin Guptill, the Kiwi batting does not lack firepower but what was more heart-warming for the fans is how batsmen like Colin Munro have tempered strokes according to situations.""It hasnt been the wham, bam...sort of way that T20 cricket has been,"" batting coach Craig McMillan said after the victory against Bangladesh in their last group match.""They have had to assess it...and have done a really good job of putting the runs on the board to give the bowlers something to work with.""",3/29/2016,WT20 Peaking England meet soaring Kiwis in first semi,cricket,NEW DELHI,Santner;Sri;Eoin;Ben Stokes;Munro;Craig McMillan;Morgan;Williamson;Nathan;Chris;Mitchell;Lanka.Jos;Buttler;Ish;Colin Munro;Colin;McCullums;Sri Lanka.Jos Buttler;Ben;Bayliss;Martin;Chris Gayle;Sodhi;Gayle;Nathan McCullums;Mitchell Santner;Stokes;Ish Sodhi;Martin Guptill;Guptill;Craig;Eoin Morgan;Trevor Bayliss;McMillan;Trevor,,Kiwi

"DELHI: England have to chase a daunting target of 154 runs, set by New Zealand, to qualify for the final of the World Twenty20 here at the Feroz Shah Kotla ground on Wednesday night.After England captain Eoin Morgan won the toss and opted for bowling, New Zealand lost their important batsman Martin Guptill for 15 runs when they were on just 17.However, their captain Kane Williamson along with Colin Munro made a rapid recovery and took the score to 91 before Williamson departed. He made 32 with three fours and a six.Later, Munro also made an exit before scoring an aggressive 46 off 32 balls with seven fours and two sixes.

"DELHI: England won the toss and elected to bowl against New Zealand in the first semi-final in World T20 here at Feroz Shah Kotla ground on Wednesday.New Zealand were facing their fifth different venue in as many matches and were they to reach the final they would do so without chasing at any time in the tournament.Expectations of a slightly quicker surface in Delhi than New Zealand had normally encountered, with limited spin, led them to include the pace of Adam Milne ahead of the offspin of Nathan McCullum - reverting to the XI which saw off Australia in Dharamsala.Eoin Morgan's decision to bowl was influenced not just by England's preference for chasing but the belief that evening dew in the second innings might tilt conditions a little in their favour. New Zealand's surprise package - the spinners Mitchell Santner and Ish Sodhi - still lay in wait.The pitch appeared to have a little grass, but given the venue's history that did not mean there would be much response for bowlers of any type. England's two previous games, against Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, had been played on slowish surfaces, one dry and slow, one damper and a little quicker, but neither offered much turn.Almost no one would have expected New Zealand to leave both Trent Boult and Tim Southee out for the entire group stage, yet the semi-final had arrived and they were excluded once more.England: Alex Hales, Jason Roy, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan (captain), Jos Buttler (wk), Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid, Chris Jordan, David Willey, Liam PlunkettNew Zealand: Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson (captain), Colin Munro, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi (wk), Mitchell Santner, Adam Milne, Ish Sodhi, Mitchell McClenaghan",3/30/2016,England bowl against New Zealand in World T20 first SF,cricket,DELHI,David Willey;Rashid;Santner;Milne;Kane;Munro;Chris;Trent Boult;Jason;Buttler;Alex;Joe;Root;Taylor;Adil Rashid;Mitchell McClenaghan;Joe Root;Sodhi;Liam;McClenaghan;Moeen Ali;Jos;Adam;Zealand;Stokes;Ish Sodhi;Guptill;David;Adil;PlunkettNew;Southee;Luke Ronchi;Roy;Moeen;Chris Jordan;Hales;Liam PlunkettNew Zealand;Willey;Kane Williamson;Grant Elliott;Tim Southee;Corey Anderson;Eoin;Ben Stokes;Morgan;Williamson;Nathan;Mitchell;Elliott;Trent;McCullum;Ross;Jordan;Ish;Nathan McCullum;Colin Munro;Colin;Grant;Boult;Jos Buttler;Luke;Ben;Martin;Ross Taylor;Anderson;Ronchi;Mitchell Santner;Martin Guptill;Adam Milne;Eoin Morgan;Tim;Alex Hales;Jason Roy;Corey;Ali,,

"MUMBAI: The second World Twenty20 semi-final is likely to hinge on who emerges on top in the battle between the big-hitting West Indian batsmen and Indias wily spinners when the former champions clash at the Wankhede Stadium on Thursday.India, the worlds top-ranked side in the shortest format, arrived at the sixth edition of the tournament with 10 wins from 11 matches in 2016 and were considered overwhelming favourites by fans, opposing captains and bookmakers alike.But while an opening Super 10 stage defeat to New Zealand, who reached the semi-finals unbeaten, was a wake-up call, the home sides credentials came into question in a one-run win over Bangladesh, who lost three wickets in the last three balls.Virat Kohlis wide blade was then called on to see off a stiff challenge from 50-over world champions Australia in a winner-takes-all contest to reach the last four, his masterclass glossing over some major batting flaws for the 2007 champions.Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma have failed to build a solid foundation for the hosts and their opening stands of five, 14, 42 and 23 have put pressure on the middle and lower order to provide a bulk of the scoring.Left-hander Suresh Rainas scores of one, zero, 30 and 10 have not been overly helpful either, and calls for the number four batsmans omission from the team have only gained momentum.Yuvraj Singhs ankle injury in the win over Australia could open the door for Ajinkya Rahane to play at his home ground in Mumbai but the right-hander may be a little rusty, having not been involved in an international match for more than a month.""You cant rely on one batsman, yes the others have contributed, but still at the same time, if we can do a bit more with the bat at the top of the order and the middle overs, I think we will feel the pressure slightly less,"" India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said after the Australia triumph.""Also, it will be good, because still we feel we are batting at 65 percent, barring Virat (Kohli).""strong>CAPTAIN COOL</strongDhoni faces the prospect of lifting a third World Cup for India after leading them in 2007 and again for the 50-overs title in 2011, the wicketkeeper lauded for his exceptional calmness and savvy against Bangladesh as India stole victory.A win on Thursday will take India to a third final in the World Twenty20 under Dhoni after they went down to South Asian rivals Sri Lanka in the last edition in Bangladesh.The strong form of his spinners and accuracy of pacemen Ashish Nehra and Jasprit Bumrah in the death overs will give Dhoni hope of taming the West Indies batsmen on a surface that has done little to help the bowlers in three matches.South Africa saw a 230-run target chased down by England, who were on the receiving end of Chris Gayles assault when they failed to defend a score of 182.At the same ground, Afghanistan gave South Africa a scare while chasing 209 until they lost too many wickets in the second half of the innings on a surface offering little respite for the bowlers at a ground with relatively short boundaries.Afghanistan also inflicted the only Super 10 defeat on West Indies with their spinners finding a way to restrict their powerful batsmen in Nagpur.The 2012 champions rested Gayle for that game and a hamstring injury to Andre Fletcher, who has since been ruled out of the tournament and replaced by Lendl Simmons, hampered their chase further.But the inability to chase down a modest 124 would have not gone unnoticed and skipper Darren Sammy is hoping it was just a one-off and not a sign of inconsistency.""We have to leave this game in Nagpur,"" Sammy said.""Well leave this game here and see it as the blip in the tournament.""Now we have two knockouts to play.

"MIAMI: Svetlana Kuznetsova held off a strong challenge from Switzerlands Timea Bacsinszky in searing afternoon heat to book her place in the Miami Open final with a 7-5 6-3 victory on Thursday.The 15th-seeded Russian relied on a never-say-die attitude and a powerful baseline game as she improved her career record to 3-0 against the Swiss, ending the match with a crunching backhand cross court winner after nearly two hours on court.Kuznetsova, who won the Miami title in 2006, will next meet either Victoria Azarenka of Belarus or second seed Angelique Kerber of Germany who were scheduled to play their semi-final later on Thursday at Crandon Park.Kuznetsova, who pulled off a stunning upset when she ousted world number one Serena Williams in the fourth round, won a hard-fought opening set after ending a brilliant baseline slugfest between the two with an overhead smash.Though she failed to hold serve in the first game of the second set, the Russian broke her 19th-seeded opponent in the second and fourth games to lead 3-1, then fought back from 15-40 down on serve in the ninth to seal victory.Bacsinszky, who beat third-seeded world number two Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland in the fourth round, converted just two of 14 breakpoint opportunities during the match.",04-01-2016,Battling Kuznetsova reaches Miami Open fi,tennis,MIAMI,Timea Bacsinszky;Serena Williams;Svetlana Kuznetsova;Timea;Bacsinszky;Victoria;Azarenka;Kuznetsova;Radwanska;Victoria Azarenka;Angelique Kerber;Williams;Svetlana;Kerber;Angelique;Agnieszka;Agnieszka Radwanska;Serena,Kuznetsova;Svetlana Kuznetsova,

"Mumbai: Aggressive opening batsman Chris Gayle usually hogs the headlines but West Indies' advance to the World Twenty20 final against England has shown they are by no means a one-man band, according to batsman Lendl Simmons.Gayle scored an unbeaten century in the Caribbean side's first pool match against England, which set up their successful run chase of 183, reaching the target with 11 balls to spare in Mumbai. Since then, he has scored nine further runs.He was dismissed for five in the semi-final against India before Simmons smashed 82 from 51 balls, while Andre Russell scored 43 from 20 to guide their side into Sunday's showdown with Eoin Morgan's team in Kolkata on Sunday.""I think England will certainly be aware that it's not a one-man show in this team,"" Simmons told reporters.""Chris Gayle didn't get off but we still managed to get over the line and it was a big total.""Even when he didn't perform, we were still able to get up and fight and that shows a lot of character from our players.""The team have needed to rely on their character and collective will after a turbulent few months in which they have been pilloried for their performances in test matches and one day internationals.They have also been galvanised by yet another bitter pay dispute with their board, who less than two months ago threatened to send a second string side to the tournament in India unless the squad accepted their offer.Since Gayle's blistering start to the tournament, others have assumed the mantle of trying to chase down the totals they have been set in all five games.Andre Fletcher scored 84 not out in their seven-wicket win over Sri Lanka, while Johnson Charles (32) and Marlon Samuels (43) saw them to a three-wicket win over South Africa.""Every one of our players are match winners in our team,"" Simmons added. ""We have a lot of batting power and I think we can chase any run total, we always back ourselves to chase totals.""That confidence has also been evident in Morgan's side after they comfortably accounted for New Zealand in the other semi-final, with man of the match Jason Roy epitomising the aggressive attitude that has filtered through the team.That aggression, and confidence, made them a better outfit than the England team that won the World Twenty20 in 2010, according to the captain of that side, Paul Collingwood.""In the past our line-up probably had one or two players that were real match-winners, this team is full of match-winners,"" Collingwood told the ECB website.""These guys are mentally different to what we used to be. 'Who dares wins' is pretty much the motto.""We probably would think, 'this is a big game' and pull back a little bit.

"KOLKATA: West Indies will face a completely different England side in Sundays World Twenty20 final compared to the one they beat in the Super 10 stage match, captain Eoin Morgan said on the eve of the title clash.Doubts crept in about Englands prospects in the sixth edition of the tournament after West Indies chased down a 182-run target at the Wankhede Stadium with almost two overs to spare, riding on an unbeaten century from opener Chris Gayle.But the 2010 champions made significant improvement in their last two matches, including a morale-boosting victory over an in-form New Zealand side in the semi-finals, to inch closer to a second T20 title.""I think its two completely different teams given that we have grown as a side game on game,"" Morgan told reporters at the Eden Gardens on Saturday.""I think its difficult to compare sides from the first game of the tournament to the final of the World Cup.""While Gayle is due for a big score having made little impact on the tournament since his blitzkrieg against England, Morgan said England could not afford to only focus on the Jamaican.""Even before we played West Indies in the group stages I was quite firm in saying that Chris Gayle wasnt just the West Indies team,"" said the 29-year-old who is himself due for runs.""Its important that when you are playing against good sides you do not focus on one or two good players.Its everybody, because anybody can hurt you,"" Morgan added.""I think India witnessed that and everybody watching the game witnessed that with Lendl Simmons innings.""Barely 12 months back, England made an ignominious exit from the 50-over World Cup and were pilloried for their negative approach to limited overs cricket.Morgan credits a change in mindset for their success.""I think the strides we have made in the last 12 months, this would be a great reward for the mindset we have showed and the hard work we have put in,"" the left-handed batsman added.""Its quite a stark difference.""Its hard to believe in some ways. I would have never imagined the turnaround being so immediate or having such an immediate impact...the key component within that has been the mindset.""I think tomorrow the opportunity we do have is a product of that.Its totally exciting...I am just very, very proud.""Morgan hopes his team mates will not be overawed by the occasion in front of over 65,000 spectators at the iconic Eden Gardens.""We know its not going to be a normal game.

They were also the first team to win two ODI World Cups as well.Their womens team also became the World T20 champions on the same day. Thus the West Indies set a unique record of winning the double crown in T20 cricket.Chasing a rather difficult target, West Indies began their innings on a disappointing note losing three wickets for just eleven runs.However, Marlon Samuels and Dwayne Bravo came to rescue and took the score to 86 before Bravo departed after hitting 25 with a six and a four.Samuels and Bravo added 65 runs for the fourth wicket and then two more wickets fell as West Indies reached 107 for six.Now they needed 49 runs from 27 balls with Samuels still at the crease as Brathwaite joined him and they were in no mood to give up the chase.They added 54 runs from 25 balls, for an unbeaten fifth wicket stand, to finish it after Brathwaite hit four consecutive sixes off Ben Stokes in the final over.David Willey claimed three wickets for 20 and Joe Root got two for nine for England.Earlier, England being sent into bat, managed to reach 155 for nine after a disastrous start losing three early wickets for just 23 runs.However, Joe Root and Jos Buttler rescued the team from collapse with a 61-run fourth wicket partnership and later Willey slogged a quick fire 21 with two sixes and a four.Root made 54 off 36 balls with seven fours while Buttler scored 36 off 22 balls with three sixes and a four.West Indian pacers Brathwaite and Bravo captured three wickets each for 23 and 37, respectively while leg-spinner Samuel Badree took two for 16.",04-03-2016,Windies become T20 champs after sensational win against England,cricket,KOLKATA,Willey;Brathwaite;Ben Stokes;Samuel;Dwayne Bravo;Buttler;Joe;Root;Dwayne;Jos Buttler;Badree;Ben;Joe Root;Jos;Stokes;Samuels;Samuel Badree;Marlon Samuels;Carlos Brathwaite;Marlon;Carlos;Bravo,,ODI World Cups

"KOLKATA: The West Indies board has offered talks with its new World Twenty20 champions to defuse a longrunning dispute saying it wants to find ways of ensuring players dont turn their backs on international cricket.The Windies victory in the final in Kolkata on Sunday night was soured by an outburst from skipper Darren Sammy who said it was disappointing the team had received no support from the board before the match.Dave Cameron, the boards president responded by calling the comments inappropriate in a statement that reserved its warmest words for the tournament organisers rather than the victorious players.However, Cameron did offer an olive branch by saying the board would meet players after the end of the Indian Premier League (IPL) next month to persuade them to play for the West Indies rather than opt for lucrative Twenty20 leagues.We want to see how we can find common ground in ensuring that the best players in the region are available for selection for West Indies teams, Cameron said.We are fully aware of the financial rewards on offer in the lucrative international T20 leagues but we believe deeply in the importance of cricket to the people of the region and of West Indies cricket s place in world cricket. It is therefore a priority to have all of our players competing and available for selection.Relations between the board and team have often been poisonous in recent years with players furious over what they see as inadequate financial rewards.A pay dispute two years ago led to the team flying home in the middle of a tour of India and the players only reluctantly agreed to sign contracts for the World T20 a few weeks before the tournament began.Many senior players, such as Chris Gayle, no longer play Test matches instead turning out in T20 leagues where they can earn more money in six weeks than they are paid by their board in a year.When the West Indies were thrashed by Australia in a Test series at the turn of the year, Gayle and Sammy were both unavailable for selection as they were playing in Australias Big Bash T20 tournament.Amid growing fears that the proliferation of T20 leagues is turning some players away from Test matches, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has said it wants to draw up a time table to avoid clashes.Many of the West Indies T20 champions are expected to play in the IPL which begins this coming weekend and ends in late May.We are aware of that schedule hence the plan to meet at that time, said Cameron. We will also engage the ICC on this so that we protect not only the rich heritage and legacy of West Indies cricket but also its future, he added.",04-04-2016,Windies board offers talks with new T20 ,cricket,KOLKATA,Cameron;Chris Gayle;Gayle;Darren;Sammy;Darren Sammy;Chris,,IPL;Windies;Indian Premier League;International Cricket Council;ICC
"LAHORE: Waqar Younis has resigned as Pakistan's coach three months before his contract was going to end, and only one day after Shahid Afridi stepped down as the T20 captain. Waqar took the decision after meeting PCB officials in Lahore.The two resignations came after Pakistan's disappointing performances in the Asia Cup in Bangladesh and the World T20 in India. Pakistan won only three games out of the eight they played across the two tournaments and failed to make it beyond the first round. The last series Pakistan won in any format was last October, when they beat England 2-0 in a three-Test series in the UAE. After that, Pakistan lost the ODI and T20 series to England, and then traveled to New Zealand to again lose the T20 and ODI series. They won only two of the 12 limited-overs matches they played in all against England and New Zealand. Pakistan are currently ranked a respectable fourth in Tests, but eighth in ODIs and seventh in T20s in the ICC rankings.Waqar had recently presented a scathing report, after Pakistan's exit from the World T20, in which he criticised the PCB's decision of not giving him a say in the selection process and lambasted Afridi's style of captaincy. The report was an overview of his two-year term as coach and was submitted to PCB chairman Shahryar Khan and to the board's fact-finding committee.A day before submitting that report, Waqar had offered to step down but had said cosmetic changes would be insufficient to solve the deeper issues in Pakistan cricket.It was Waqar's second tenure as coach after he was appointed in May 2014 for a two-year contract. His first stint as head coach was in 2010-11 and he had then resigned citing personal reasons.",04-04-2016,Waqar Younis steps down as head ,cricket,LAHORE,Shahryar Khan;Khan;Shahid Afridi;Shahryar;Younis;Afridi;Waqar Younis;Shahid;Waqar,Waqar Younis,ICC;PCB;Waqar

"KOLKATA: Kolkata Knight Riders responded with a 'horses for courses' approach on a greenish Eden Gardens surface. Shakib Al Hasan and Morne Morkel, central to their plans last season, were benched.Sunil Narine, who played a stellar role in their title-winning run in 2012 and 2014, was unavailable because of his father's demise. Did it hamper them? It didn't look like, as Andre Russell and Brad Hogg took three wickets apiece to skittle Delhi Daredevils for 98. Robin Uthappa and Gautam Gambhir's 69-run opening then set the tone for a comfortable win with 35 balls to spare.Russell and John Hastings, taking Morkel's place, ran in hard and hit the deck to extract unusual bounce. Quinton de Kock, who had pulled Umesh Yadav for back-to-back boundaries, was the first to go when he skewed a catch to mid-off. Three balls later, Shreyas Iyer was trapped lbw for a duck.Mayank Agarwal and Karun Nair also exited in successive overs as Hastings capped the Powerplay with a wicket maiden. By then, Daredevils were in a familiar spot at 35 for 4. Pawan Negi, who was promoted to No.6, swished and missed balls. He was finally put out of his misery when Hogg had him stumped for a 19-ball 11.IPL debutant Carlos Brathwaite, who fired West Indies to their second World T20 title last week, momentarily broke the shackles with a biff over wide long-on, but was foxed by a skiddy googly from Piyush Chawla two balls later. Sanju Samson was the eighth Daredevils batsman to be dismissed before Hastings made a reappearance to wrap up the innings. Daredevils had slumped to their seventh sub-100 score in IPL, which also happened to be the second-lowest score in the tournament's history at Eden Gardens.The chase was a stroll for Knight Riders, and the onset of dew only made things worse. Zaheer Khan, playing his first competitive game since May 2015, floated flick-me balls in the lower 120kph range to Gambhir's pads and got picked away for three fours in the second over.

I am happy to win another title here and this triumph certainly boosts my spirits ahead of the Olympics.Chen called Lee a role model for young Malaysian shuttlers and said he was happy to have qualified for the final.It is not easy for a player at his age to maintain a highlevel performance yearin yearout and you can see the crowd really appreciated that said Chen.I felt I played well but it was my first time playing in this court and perhaps the drift was too strong.Lee had missed last year s edition because of a suspension after testing positive for a banned antiinflammatory substance at the world championships in Copenhagen in 2014. But in April last year the Badminton World Federation said the former longtime world number one had accidentally ingested the substance and handed him an eightmonth backdated ban which effectively allowed him to resume his career.Lee one of Malaysia's most popular sports stars has repeatedly fallen short in his pursuit of the sport s top prizes  the world and Olympic titles despite reaching three world championship finals and two Olympic deciders.

"MOHALI: Aaron Finch and Dwayne Bravo helped Gujarat Lions ease into the IPL with a thumping win against Kings XI Punjab in Mohali, the third one-sided affair of the season in three games.Barring the first over, Lions were in total control of the 162 chase after Finch set it up with his first IPL fifty since 2014.Brendon McCullum, fresh off a whirlwind ton in his last Test, danced down the track off Sandeep Sharma in the first over with keeper Wriddhiman Saha standing up.Sandeep, though, anticipated a forward shimmy and bowled the perfect outswinger to leave McCullum stranded. Finch and Suresh Raina then took the attack to the pacers, both capitalizing on loose deliveries along with intermittent swipes.After Raina holed out to mid-on in the sixth over, Finch peppered the boundary with deft touch and exemplary placement, particular behind square on the off side.His 47-ball 74 saw 12 boundaries, and it required a moment of brilliance from the debutant Pardeep Sahu to remove him. Sahu drew Finch forward but the legspinner beat him in flight and loop, as Saha completed his second stumping off the innings.The rest of the innings was a mere formality as Dinesh Karthik accrued his runs in typical fashion, with his sweeps being the most productive.Kings XI were given an ideal start by their openers - M Vijay and Manan Vohra - who saw off the swinging new ball before getting stuck into their work. A blend of crisp drives and flicks earned the pair a fifty-run stand within the Powerplay.The spreading field did not impede Vohra, as he manufactured boundaries with the use of his feet off the spinners.However, momentum shifted rapidly as Ravindra Jadeja struck twice in consecutive overs to remove the openers. Dwayne Bravo undid Glenn Maxwell and David Miller in the space of three balls with contrasting yorkers.Bravo became the first bowler to 300 T20 wickets with his new weapon - the slow, dipping yorker that deceived Miller.Suddenly, debutant Marcus Stoinis and Wriddhiman Saha were left to rebuild a rollicking start. The pair were forced to use the large Mohali pockets to find their runs, but struggled to find the boundaries towards the end. Much of that was down to the efficiency of the Lions bowlers, who executed their yorkers and slower balls.Bravo took two more wickets off consecutive slower balls in the last over, and could have had his best T20 bowling figures had Sarabjit Ladda pouched a skier off the last ball. Just two boundaries and 36 runs were scored off the last five overs, and Kings XI could muster 161.",04-11-2016,Gujrat begin IPL campaign with 5 wkt win over Punjab,cricket,MOHALI,Marcus Stoinis;Suresh;Vijay;Pardeep;Jadeja;Glenn Maxwell;Maxwell;Manan;Ravindra Jadeja;Ravindra;Suresh Raina;Finch;Raina;Pardeep Sahu;Karthik;Brendon;Brendon McCullum;Marcus;Miller;David;Bravo;Dinesh Karthik;Saha;Sandeep;Wriddhiman Saha;Aaron;Aaron Finch;Dwayne Bravo;McCullum;Glenn;Sarabjit;Sahu;Wriddhiman;Dwayne;Sandeep Sharma;Manan Vohra;David Miller;Ladda;Vohra;Sharma;Dinesh;Sarabjit Ladda;Stoinis,,Gujarat Lions;IPL;Kings XI Punjab;Lions

"KOLKATA: Mitchell McClenaghan walked out at No. 4 for Mumbai Indians. It is not like the side is short of hitters but Jos Buttler caught fire only after the spark provided by McClenaghan's eight-ball 20. The events between the 11th and the 15th overs of the chase decided the winner of the match - Mumbai, by six wickets.McClenaghan's responsibility - under normal circumstances - was to slip into Lasith Malinga's shoes. Be the wicket-taker at the start and the enforcer at the end. Today, he was asked to disrupt the Kolkata Knight Riders' rhythm. And he was given the freedom to do so. Every single shot played by the New Zealand fast bowler was a slog. His second, third and fourth balls cleared the Eden Gardens boundaries. The eighth - a wide full toss that he tried to slog sweep - led to his downfall but by then Mumbai had regained lost momentum. And Buttler simply ran with it.A straight drive against chinaman Brad Hogg was followed by a pulled six. The equation shrunk from 101 off 60 balls to 49 off 30. A scoop to the fine leg boundary - which established Buttler's finesse - and two lofted cover drives - which established his power - deflated Knight Riders. Gautam Gambhir, who had taken the record (27) for the most fifties in the IPL earlier in the night, watched the ball soar and the chances for his team sink with every minute Buttler was on strike.When Buttler eventually fell for 41 off 22 balls, the Mumbai captain, Rohit Sharma, back at his preferred opening position, provided more evidence of why he should be given as many overs as possible in a T20 game. Rohit held the innings together and even finished it off with an array of beautiful shots - a straight six and a deft glide to third man. He followed those up with an outrageous sweep taking an overpitched delivery coming at him with the express pace of Andre Russell from around the wicket, and deposited it at the midwicket boundary.

"Cristiano Ronaldo's fifth Champions League hat-trick inspired Real Madrid to a 3-0 comeback victory over VfL Wolfsburg on Tuesday that clinched a place in the semi-finals for a sixth successive season.The prolific Portuguese got the 10-times European champions, 2-0 down from the first leg, off to a perfect start by tapping in Daniel Carvajal's cross after 16 minutes and heading a second goal less than a minute later from Toni Kroos' corner.Ronaldo capped a 3-2 win on aggregate when he curled in a free kick after 77 minutes, his 16th goal in this season's competition taking him within touching distance of his record of 17 in 2013-14.He also equalled Barcelona rival Lionel Messi's record of five Champions League trebles as he took his goal tally in all competitions this season to 46.""It's a day for celebration,"" said Real coach Zinedine Zidane.

In doing so, they also bucked the season's early trend of chasing teams prevailing.AB de Villiers (82) and Virat Kohli (75) provided a visual treat courtesy a fine cocktail of fineness and brute force in a 157-run second-wicket stand, before Shane Watson announced himself by muscling three successive sixes in an over from Karn Sharma. The final flourish was lent by Sarfaraz Khan, who in his typically unorthodox fashion, paddled and reverse-paddled his way to an unbeaten 10-ball 35 as Royal Challengers finished with 227 for 4.Deflated and dejected, Sunrisers went for broke, wiping out 83 for the loss of Shikhar Dhawan in eight overs. David Warner, who returned to open after a brief flirtation in the middle order with Australia in the World T20, showed why he is one of the most feared white-ball strikers. He muscled three sixes and five fours in a 21-ball half-century before falling into the short-ball trap laid by Watson.The pressure of the required rate eventually got to Sunrisers and the chase went cold as the team lost Warner, Naman Ojha, Henriques and Deepak Hooda in the space of 17 deliveries, meaning they could only muster 182 for 6. Parvez Rasool was the pick of Royal Challengers' bowlers, returning 1 for 31 in a crafty spell of offspin bowling, even as Watson and Yuzvendra Chahal, the legspiner, chipped away with two wickets.Chris Gayle's dismissal for 1 in the second over of the match to Bhuvneshwar Kumar, when the ball brushed the thigh pad and deflected onto the leg stump, was a rare moment to cheer for a listless Sunrisers bowling attack that was further depleted when Ashish Nehra, their pace spearhead, hobbled off the field after just 2.1 overs. That resulted in a batting feast for two men in a murderous mood as Royal Challengers blasted 139 off the last 10 overs.The only semblance of respect from Kohli and de Villiers came early on when Mustafizur Rahman, making his IPL debut, troubled them with his cutters. Once the job of seeing off his initial burst - a two-over spell - was done, they let loose. Sarfaraz's unbeaten 44-run stand off just 15 deliveries with Kedar Jadhav ensured Royal Challengers had momentum firmly by their side at the break.Dhawan's early wicket to Rasool was a setback for Sunrisers, but Warner's muscle kept his team in the hunt as Kohli rang in the changes in a bid to pull things back. Adam Milne's second spell, in which he had Moises Henriques mistime a pull to midwicket, opened the game up. Once Royal Challengers had one foot in the door, it was a simple matter of forcing it open, which they did quite easily. In the end, even Ashish Reddy's big hitting was merely a footnote for Sunrisers in what was a forgettable outing.",4/13/2016,RCB crush Sunrisers after hitting 227 4,cricket,BANGALORE,Shane;Naman Ojha;Milne;Watson;Kedar;Hooda;Karn;Ojha;Mustafizur Rahman;Ashish;Parvez;Nehra;Deepak Hooda;David Warner;Virat;Bhuvneshwar;Moises;Ashish Nehra;Chahal;Mustafizur;Adam;Virat Kohli;Henriques;Ashish Reddy;Rahman;Kohli;David;Kumar;Khan;Yuzvendra Chahal;Kedar Jadhav;Warner;Sarfaraz Khan;Shane Watson;Yuzvendra;Parvez Rasool;Jadhav;Sarfaraz;Shikhar Dhawan;Naman;Moises Henriques;Gayle;Rasool;Sharma;Reddy;Shikhar;Adam Milne;Bhuvneshwar Kumar;Karn Sharma;Dhawan;Sunrisers;Deepak,,Warner;Royal Challengers;IPL;Royal Challengers Bangalore

"NEW YORK: Maria Sharapova and scores of other athletes who have tested positive for meldonium could be handed a lifeline after the World Anti-Doping Agency said there was a lack of scientific evidence about how long the drug stays in the system.Amid growing confusion about the status of an avalanche of positive tests for the drug, which was banned on 1 January this year, Wada said its preliminary tests showed that it could take weeks or months for the drug to leave the body. In such cases, athletes could not reasonably have known or suspected that the drug would still be present in their bodies after 1 January, said WADA in a clarification paper to its code signatories on how they should prosecute meldonium cases.In these circumstances Wada considers that there may be grounds for no fault or negligence on the part of the athlete, it added. Sir Craig Reedie, the president of Wada, said: It is designed to explain the science that we know. The issue that it deals with is the time this drug takes to come out of the system. Its an attempt to clarify the many questions that weve been asked.The Russian sports ministry and national Olympic committee welcomed the Wada statement, and the countrys officials suggested there could be a mass amnesty of Russian athletes.The head of the Russian tennis federation (RTF), Shamil Tarpishchev, told the R-Sport agency he hoped Sharapova would be able to play at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in August, while the head of the Russian swimming federation suggested there could be a swift return to competition for the suspended world champion Yulia Efimova.A Wada spokesman said talk of an amnesty was wide of the mark and that the document was designed to clarify the position.Sharapova confirmed last month that she had tested positive for meldonium during the Australian Open.

"MADRID: Lionel Messi's 500th career goal couldn't prevent Barcelona's incredible slump in form from continuing with a fourth defeat in five games 2-1 at home to Valencia on Sunday.Atletico Madrid are now level on 76 points with Barca at the top of La Liga with five games remaining as they beat Granada 3-0, but the Catalans retain the lead thanks to their superior head-to-head record.Third-placed Real Madrid are also only a point behind thanks to their 5-1 win at Getafe on Saturday.Valencia were beaten 7-0 by Barca on their last trip to the Camp Nou just two months ago under former boss Gary Neville, but gained revenge thanks to Ivan Rakitic's own goal and Santi Mina's classy finish before half-time.Messi ended a five-game goal drought to bring up his 500th for club and country, but couldn't inspire a Barca fightback as their alarming collapse in recent weeks continued after a 39-game unbeaten run.Having looked well set for a second consecutive treble just two weeks ago, Barca could now miss out on all three major trophies as they were dumped out of the Champions League by Atletico in midweek and have taken just one point from their last four La Liga games.However, in contrast to recent defeats, Barca boss Luis Enrique praised the performance of his side and believes they are capable of winning their last five games to retain the title.""Luck didn't shine on the team. I congratulate my players for how they faced the adversity during the game,"" said Enrique.""We still depend on ourselves. Our margin for error has run out and we are aware of the challenge.""Now we have a marvellous challenge, five games in which if we win them all we are champions""Barca started brightly, but were repeatedly denied by fine saves from Valencia goalkeeper Diego Alves.The Brazilian blocked Messi's volley from close range before somehow springing to punch away Neymar's lob which seemed destined to evade him.However, Valencia amazingly went in at half-time two goals to the good having had just one shot on target.The visitors went in front on 27 minutes when Rakitic turned Guilherme Siqueira's cross into his own net at the near post and doubled their lead thanks to a brilliant move in first-half stoppage time as Dani Parejo played in Mina to fire into the far corner.Rakitic had a huge chance to make amends for his own goal a minute into the second-half, but pulled his effort tamely wide from Luis Suarez's fine cut-back.However, Barca were finally given hope when Jordi Alba's low cross was turned home by Messi to reach another historic landmark.Alves came to Valencia's rescue once more with his best save of the night low to his right to prevent Rakitic equalising 15 minutes from time.Neymar's fiercely struck volley was somehow deflected behind by Shkodran Mustafi, but Valencia should also have killed the game off at the other end when Paco Alcacer miscued from point-blank range allowing Sergio Busquets to clear off the line.Gerard Pique then had a glorious chance to salvage at least a point late on, but he pulled his shot wide with just Alves to beat.In contrast to Barca's collapse, Atletico are flying in the final stages of the season as Fernando Torres struck his fourth goal in as many games in a routine win over Granada.""It will be tough (to win the league), but we will play as the schedule demands us to which is to win, win and win again,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone.Koke ensured Atletico would have no hangover from their efforts in dispatching Barca from the Champions League in midweek as he swept home the opener on 15 minutes before teeing up Torres to dink home just before the hour mark.Substitute Angel Correa rounded off the scoring with a cool finish seven minutes from time.",4/18/2016,Messi nets 500th goal but Barcelona ,football,MADRID,Santi;Siqueira;Jordi Alba;Ivan;Paco;Santi Mina;Lionel Messi;Guilherme Siqueira;Paco Alcacer;Torres;Alcacer;Angel;Diego;Gary Neville;Jordi;Simeone.Koke;Luis;Dani;Enrique;Messi;Shkodran;Alves;Parejo;Fernando Torres;Diego Simeone.Koke;Mina;Correa;Lionel;Shkodran Mustafi;Sergio Busquets;Busquets;Ivan Rakitic;Alba;Rakitic;Guilherme;Angel Correa;Gary;Luis Suarez;Suarez;Mustafi;Sergio;Neville;Luis Enrique;Fernando;Dani Parejo;Neymar,Messi;Lionel Messi,Catalans;Granada;Barca;La Liga;Barcelona;Real Madrid;Sunday.Atletico Madrid;Atletico;Valencia

"BARCELONA: Barcelonas stuttering title bid suffered another setback when they lost 2-1 at home to Valencia as they registered a third straight La Liga defeat for the first time since 2003.Luis Enriques shell-shocked side are level on 76 points with Atletico Madrid, who knocked the holders out of the Champions League in midweek, and remain top only due to a superior head-to-head record.An own goal by Ivan Rakitic put Valencia ahead after 27 minutes and Santi Mina added a second just before halftime to stun the Barca supporters at the Nou Camp.<br/> Lionel Messi scored his 500th career goal to reduce the deficit after 64 minutes but the struggling hosts, who have squandered a nine-point lead, could not find an equaliser.Valencia goalkeeper Diego Alves produced a spectacular save to deny Rakitic late on and Gerard Pique agonisingly missed the target at the near post in stoppage time.Earlier, Atletico Madrid eased to a 3-0 home win over struggling Granada to go level with Barcelona on points after Fernando Torres grabbed his fourth goal in as many games.Spain international Koke opened the scoring after 15 minutes and then teed up Torres for the second in the 59th, while substitute Angel Correa rounded off the victory in the 83rd.Atletico, boosted by a 2-0 win over Barca on Wednesday which put them into the Champions League semi-finals, started brightly with Koke blazing over the bar moments after kick-off.The midfielder proved more accurate minutes later, pouncing on a loose ball after Torress effort was blocked and drilling a shot into the net.Granada winger Ruben Rochina hit the post later in the half before Torres eased Atleticos nerves by notching the second, latching onto a threaded pass by Koke to lift the ball over goalkeeper Andres Fernandez and into the far corner.Argentine forward Correa came on to replace Atleticos top scorer Antoine Griezmann and made the most of his cameo appearance by racing onto a pass from Saul Niguez down the left and tucking the ball into the far bottom corner.",4/18/2016,Barcelona rocked by 2 1 home defeat to Valenci,football,BARCELONA,Fernandez;Fernando Torres;Santi;Ruben Rochina;Mina;Granada;Diego Alves;Gerard Pique;Correa;Lionel;Pique;Ivan Rakitic;Rochina;Ivan;Antoine;Andres Fernandez;Rakitic;Santi Mina;Lionel Messi;Angel Correa;Saul Niguez;Torres;Andres;Saul;Angel;Diego;Luis Enriques;Antoine Griezmann;Niguez;Enriques;Ruben;Gerard;Griezmann;Luis;Fernando;Messi;Koke;Alves,,La Liga;Nou Camp;Barcelona;Atletico;Atletico Madrid;Valencia;Barca

"BANGALORE: Virat Kohlis 48-ball 79 powered Royal Challengers Bangalore to 191 for 5, and AB de Villiers and Shane Watson chipped in with 55 and 33. But their efforts were put to shade by Quinton de Kock, who made a bruising 51-ball 108, the first hundred in IPL 2016, to power Delhi Daredevils to a seven-wicket win at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.While De Kock starred in the lead role, Karun Nair, who hails from Bangalore, played the supporting role in 134-run third-wicket stand that came off 76 balls.Kohli showed he can be equally dangerous when setting targets. The groundwork was laid during the course of his second-wicket stand of 107 with de Villiers before Daredevils hit back with a tremendous exhibition of late-overs bowling courtesy the returning Mohammed Shami and Chris Morris, who conceded only 27 off the last four overs.Daredevils were dealt an early blow when Shreyas Iyer was dismissed by Shane Watson but it had little effect on de Kock as he pierced a packed off-side field for three fours off the offspinner Parvez Rasool in the second over.De Kock was particularly punishing through the off side, a majority of his runs coming behind square. Once he was set, the other elements to his game surfaced. A nonchalant flick off Harshal Patel in the ninth over soared over deep square leg, and once he was into the 90s he used the pace to scoop the ball over short fine leg. The end result was a wagon wheel with spokes all around the wicket.De Kock's sparkling form helped Daredevils ride a trough when Sanju Samson struggled to play his shots, but his dismissal in the sixth over turned their fortunes. Nair and de Kock got stuck in against Yuzvendra Chahal, Harshal Patel and David Wiese, whose combined tally at one point was 78 conceded off seven overs.

"MELBOURNE: South Africa are reluctant to play a day-night test during their tour of Australia as they have no experience with the pink ball, the Proteas players association chief has said.South Africa will tour Australia in a three-test series in the home summer and Cricket Australia announced last year that they wanted one of the fixtures to be a day-night match.Australia hosted New Zealand in the first day-night test in November and while the match drew huge crowds and big television audiences players on both sides complained that the ball was hard to see at times.The pink ball has been developed for day-night test cricket, replacing the traditional red ball which becomes too difficult for batsmen to see after dark.""Our players are not in favour of playing the game under those conditions,"" South African players association Chief Executive Tony Irish told The Australian newspaper.""The main reason is we feel disadvantaged. Not one of our players who will compete in that test has played test match cricket, or any cricket, with a pink ball.""The reluctance to play is a sign of how much importance the South African players place on the series against Australia,"" Irish added.New Zealand players had similar misgivings about last years fixture in Adelaide but were given a A$1 million ($777,000) sweetener by Cricket Australia to commit.Organisers hailed the test a success, despite Australia wrapping up victory in three days.Adelaide tests are traditionally well supported by local fans and interstate visitors but the total attendance of 123,000 was a record in the city for a non-Ashes fixture.Australia, who have also used the pink ball in domestic Sheffield Shield matches, host Pakistan in a three-test series in the coming home summer, with a match at Brisbanes Gabba ground tipped to be played under lights.Cricket Australia will announce their summer schedule on Wednesday and declined to comment on South Africas reservations about the pink ball.",4/19/2016,South Africa players against day night ,cricket,MELBOURNE,Tony;Tony Irish;Irish,,Cricket Australia

"HYDERABAD: David Warners unbeaten 59-ball 90 steered Sunrisers Hyderabad to their first win of the season after their bowlers had kept Mumbai Indians to 142 in conditions that led to a well-matched contest between bat and ball.Southee kept Mumbai in the game with three well-timed wickets, starting with a late-swinging yorker to Shikhar Dhawan, but Mumbai kept feeding Warner a steady supply of release balls, which he put away merrily.He ended the game with two sixes in three balls, flat-batting Mitchell McClenaghan over mid-off and pulling him over deep square leg, and Sunrisers were home with 15 balls remaining. Mumbai's defeat was their third in four matches.It only took four balls for Bhuvneshwar Kumar to strike, though it was swing rather than seam that did the damage. With Kieron Pollard out due to food poisoning, Mumbai had brought in Martin Guptill, and his debut innings in the IPL was terminated by a perfectly pitched outswinger that kissed his edge through to the wicketkeeper.Parthiv Patel looked distinctly uncomfortable against the swinging ball, playing and missing repeatedly before he was bowled by a back-of-the-hand slower ball from Barinder Sran that jagged in like a left-arm wristspinner's googly. Then came a self-inflicted wound - Rohit, who came in at No. 4, running himself out while looking for a suicidal single. When Jos Buttler, surprised by extra pace from Sran, gloved an attempted pull in the 11th over, they were 60 for 4 and going nowhere.At the crease now were Ambati Rayudu, who had been promoted to No. 3, and Krunal Pandya, who had been promoted to No. 6 ahead of his brother Hardik, who had batted at No. 3 in all of Mumbai's previous matches. All the meddling with the batting order indicated a muddled think-tank, but Rayudu and Krunal made the most of their opportunities.Moises Henriques and the left-arm spinner Bipul Sharma varied their pace cleverly in the middle overs. But Bipul, who had gone for only 14 off his first three overs, was struck three successive sixes by Krunal in the 14th over.

"MOHALI: Kolkata Knight Riders thrashed Kings XI Punjab by six wickets here on Sunday to go on top of the table in the Indian Premier League 2016.Knight Riders' bowling depth was perceptible as their spinners ripped through Kings XI, in a sub-par batting performance, to keep them to 138 for 8.In the chase, Robin Uthappa's quickfire fifty effectively sealed the game. In 13 games this season, 12 have been won by the chasing team.Put in to bat, Kings XI lost Manan Vohra early when he flicked Morne Morkel to deep square leg but M Vijay looked in rhythm, scything drives and cuts before failing to pick a googly from Piyush Chawla.The stage was set for either of David Miller or Glenn Maxwell to fire their side back into the contest, but Knight Riders' experienced bowling attack strangled their strong middle order.With two left-handers batting - Marsh and Miller - Gautam Gambhir turned to Yusuf Pathan for the first time this season. The move reaped rewards instantly when Miller edged Yusuf's first ball and Uthappa took a sharp catch.Maxwell soon resorted to a switch-hit off Sunil Narine, but Kings XI's season was summed up when he hammered it to extra cover. Narine's remodeled action returned two wickets in a frugal spell with an economy rate of 5.50.In a format where teams target implausible numbers during the second half of an innings, Knight Riders' spinners ensured Kings XI could only rebuild after leaving them at 94 for 5 in the 15th over.In between, Marsh used swift footwork to accumulate runs and was particularly effective square of the wicket, on both sides. He got to his fifty in the last over with a sweetly-timed lofted drive over long-on. Along with Kyle Abbott, he took Andre Russell's first over - the last of the innings - for 18 to lift Kings XI to 138.Kings XI needed a miraculous start but Uthappa and Gambhir pushed Knight Riders closer to the target with nine boundaries in a 65-run Powerplay, the most productive in this season.The seamers, Sandeep Sharma and Abbott, were inconsistent but when they found their lengths, Uthappa cleared the infield with lofted strokes on the up, on a pitch offering even bounce and carry.Uthappa eased himself to his first fifty of the season off just 24 balls but his premeditated sweep resulted in his dismissal, as he played around a full delivery from Pardeep Sahu. Gambhir looked set for another fifty before a leading edge was acrobatically taken by Glenn Maxwell, running in from deep midwicket.Axar Patel removed Manish Pandey and Shakib Al Hasan, but Suryakumar Yadav and Yusuf took Knight Riders home with 17 balls to spare.",4/20/2016,Kolkata thrash Punjab to go on top in IPL,cricket,MOHALI,Vijay;Pardeep;Hasan;Glenn Maxwell;Sunil;Maxwell;Manan;Piyush;Yusuf;Pardeep Sahu;Uthappa;Gautam Gambhir;Pathan;Kyle;Narine;Suryakumar Yadav;Gambhir;Gautam;Abbott;Shakib;Russell;Suryakumar;Kyle Abbott;Miller;David;Robin;Manish Pandey;Sandeep;Al;Robin Uthappa;Shakib Al Hasan;Morkel;Morne;Yusuf Pathan;Sunil Narine;Glenn;Sahu;Yadav;Sandeep Sharma;Manan Vohra;David Miller;Manish;Andre;Vohra;Morne Morkel;Sharma;Andre Russell;Pandey;Marsh;Patel,,Kings XI;Knight Riders

"MUMBAI: Rohit Sharmas 44-ball 62 helped Mumbai Indians to overhaul Royal Challengers Bangalore' 170 for seven with 12 balls to spare here at the Wankhede Stadium on Wednesday.His batting was fluid as he took charge of the chase along with Ambati Raid, who was anything but elegant yet equally effective during his 31.The second-wicket stand of 76 in 55 balls laid the platform for Mumbai's chase, before Iqbal Abdulla gave Royal Challengers a new lease of life by dismissing Rayudu and Rohit in quick succession, both to slogs.Mumbai were 109 for three then, needing 62 off seven overs - well on track as dew took effect. Jos Buttler and Kieron Pollard, returning from food poisoning, flexed their muscles by hitting five sixes between them, and Mumbai recorded their second win in five matches.Mumbai, who opted to bowl, were staring at a 200-plus target as Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers feasted on some friendly bowling during the course of a 59-run stand, before the unheralded players, in what was billed as a battle of two heavyweight teams, rose to the occasion.Krunal Pandyas twin strikes to get rid of Kohli and de Villiers in the space of five deliveries stunned Royal Challengers. Shane Watson fell not long after, but then Travis Head, on IPL debut, and Sarfaraz Khan lifted Royal Challengers from 99 for 4 to 170 for 7.KL Rahul was put through a short-ball test in a hostile burst by Mitchell McClenaghan, during which he was hit hard on the helmet. After the early jitters, though, he ramped and slapped his way to 23 before being caught in the slips. Kohli and de Villiers then counterpunched before the cluster of wickets resulted in a complete breakdown in momentum.Head took his time to settle in before exhibiting his ball-striking power to swat Hardik Pandya for six over deep square leg in the 15th over. Sarfaraz showed there is more to his game than just scoops and paddles as he milked the spinners before clubbing Jasprit Bumrah for two successive sixes in the final over.Mumbai lost Parthiv Patel in the second over of the chase, but Varun Aaron's third over, which went for 19, brought their innings back on track. Once Royal Challengers' uncapped Indian bowlers were summoned, a game that was only marginally tilted in Mumbai's favour turned decisively in their direction. Abdulla's wickets injected a touch of excitement, but any possibility of a close finish was firmly snuffed out by Pollard's charge.",4/21/2016,Mumbai Indians outclass RC Bangalor,cricket,MUMBAI,Rayudu;Shane;Hardik;Varun Aaron;Varun;Watson;Travis Head;Raid;Sharmas;Pollard;Buttler;Virat;Jasprit Bumrah;Rohit;Head;Iqbal Abdulla;Mitchell McClenaghan;McClenaghan;Jos;Virat Kohli;Parthiv Patel;Kieron Pollard;Kohli;Jasprit;Kieron;Bumrah;Pandya;Khan;Ambati Raid;KL Rahul;Aaron;Hardik Pandya;Sarfaraz Khan;Mitchell;Parthiv;Shane Watson;Ambati;Sarfaraz;KL;Rahul;Jos Buttler;Abdulla;Travis;Rohit Sharmas;Iqbal;Patel,,Mumbai Indians;IPL;Royal Challengers Bangalore
"ISLAMABAD: Batting coach Grant Flower has claimed that Pakistani batsmen are not as hard working as far as fitness is concerned saying our players are very inconsistent with the way they practice.Flower said Pakistani batsmen remain in the elusion that whatever they have been doing in order to keep themselves fit is enough for them to excel in the international circuit.At the international level most of the guys techniques are sound. With Pakistan, it is more trying to get the routine right but it is also about the preparation off the field regarding fitness, Flower told ESPNCricinfo.You not only need that in fielding and bowling but equally in batting.<br/> If you are physically fit it will definitely lead to a good life style and better judgement at the crease he said.Flower said, our players are very inconsistent with the way they practice. They do work on their weak areas but they could do a lot more. When you are an international player you should be waking up and asking yourself what I have to do more to improve myself. If you are not answering that question then I dont think you should be there, he said.Flower said that the upcoming camp for the national team ahead of their tour of England will also have a session with a psychologist.He said he hopes that the upcoming camp will also cover the psychologist session and the players take that in a positive manner.Flower said it requires a lot of sacrifice to play for the country.A good student of the game learns everyday life style gym work and all those things required to be a better cricketer, he said.He claimed that it is not like 20 minutes in the gym and 20 minutes in the nets.<br/> It is about quality time absorbing everything rather than just being seen doing the right stuff and walking away saying that I have done enough. A lot of guys kid themselves.They think they are doing enough to be playing for Pakistan and getting great results. I know a lot of time they are not doing enough.

"ISLAMABAD: Paul Hawkins, the inventor of the balltracking HawkEye ball tracking system has now come up with a bat sensor to pick up nicks perfectly.<br/> The sensor is the size of a small coin and uses an accompanying smart phone app to detect the nicks.The on-field umpires will have to attach the smart phones to their jackets to film each ball so that instant replays and ball trajectories can be replayed and monitored, a prominent sports website www.sportskeeda.com reported.The tiny sensor which costs 25 (AUD46) can easily be fixed to the bat for the phone to film and monitor the ball.Hawkins, who was a former county player and a missile guidance expert, has confirmed that the technology is almost ready to be used and might be introduced into amateur cricket in England soon.Hawkins had been watching a Hampshire cricket league match last year and had been left very disappointed to see a batsman stand his ground after being out caught behind as the umpire failed to detect the edge.That incident has led Hawkins to come up with his ingenious technological innovation to change cricket.Batsmen have always not walked but what really got me was that after the inevitable bout of sledging from the fielders the batsman said I know I nicked it and you know I did but so what it wasnt given Hawkins was quoted as saying. More and more batsmen try and get away with it. We got him out soon afterwards but it ruined my day.Hawkins technology works much like the realtime Snicko meter with the bat sensor picking up vibrations in the bat and making the results readily available on the smart phones to be worn by the on-field umpires.We experimented in the nets and found that even the finest edge a feather that the bowler didnt hear is detected, Hawkins said.",4/22/2016,New technology to detect edges in cricket to be launched ,cricket,ISLAMABAD,Hawkins;Paul;Paul Hawkins,,Hampshire

"STUTTGART, Germany: Australian Open champion Angelique Kerber picked up her second title of 2016 with a 6-4, 6-0 victory over qualifier Laura Siegemund for backtoback wins in Stuttgart on Sunday.Its amazing to be able to defend my title here beamed Kerber after her repeat success in the WTA claycourt tournament. I had goose bumps its simply been a perfect week.In an allGerman final, Kerber claimed her first win since her Melbourne triumph in January with an impressive display against Siegemund.The qualifier had beaten seeds Simona Halep, Roberta Vinci and Agnieszka Radwanska, all ranked in the worlds top ten.I have never felt so much emotion out on the tennis court as I have in the last few days, said Siegemund, a trained psychologist who is working towards her doctorate.It happened exactly as I feared it would God pulled the plug on me she added after the final took just 81 minutes.I haven t had a day off here and no time to enjoy my results so I ll definitely do that now.Having not dropped a set en route, this was Siegemunds debut in a WTA final and Kerbers first since the Australian Open.Kerber beat her Germany Fed Cup teammate Annika Beck in the secondround then Spains Carla SuarezNavarro in the quarters and Petra Kvitova in the semifinal.But the world number three got off to a false start when she found herself 3-0 down in the tight first set before fighting her way back.She then raced into a 2-0 lead in the second as Siegemund had to briefly receive treatment.Kerber then dominated the 28-year-old Siegemund, who will shoot up the world rankings from 71 to 42 on the back of her performances in Stuttgart and kept finding her shots on the baseline to quickly race to a 4-0 lead.Having broken Siegemund to go 5-0 up, Kerber used her first championship ball to seal the win which again includes the prize of a luxury sports car.Having suffered a drop in form after her Melbourne triumph, Kerber says she has had to learn to deal with the hype of being a Grand Slam winner.I have learnt in the last few weeks to use every single minute to store up with energy and strength said Kerber as she got her claycourt season off to a winning start.

"JOHANNESBURG: South Africa on Monday banned its national cricket and rugby federations from hosting or bidding for international tournaments for at least a year due to their failure to increase representation of black players.Sports minister Fikile Mbalula said the athletics and netball federations were also barred from bidding to stage global events after a report showed that four out of the five biggest sports have failed to create enough opportunities for black players.The ministers decision was a major blow to the South African Rugby Unions intention to bid for the 2023 Rugby World Cup. The bidding process starts next month.South Africas government has been pushing for more black players to be included in the nations most popular sports but more than two decades after the end of apartheid whites still make up the bulk of players in athletics, cricket, netball and rugby.""I have therefore resolved to revoke the privilege of Athletics South Africa (ASA), Cricket South Africa (CSA), Netball South Africa (NSA) and South African Rugby (SARU) to host and bid for major and mega international tournaments,"" Mbalula said in a statement.The soccer federation was the only one of the five to meet its transformation targets, he said.Mbalula said he would review the decision when considering the results on the 2016-17 Transformation Barometer, which could be at the end of next year.

He said Afridi appeared to be under so much pressure it really reflected poorly on the team.The whole team morale was down because they all felt the pressure from the captain.No matter how many times I talk to the players it is the captain who has to lead the boys on the field and execute plans, he said.Speaking about the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and selection matters in the report, he said just before the World Cup 2015 in Australia and New Zealand he attended the selection meeting in Karachi along with then captain Misbah ul Haq.We had a long and fruitful meeting on several players. As I arrived back in Lahore a completely different team was announced which I was not happy with also after dropping Younis Khan from one series, he was suddenly put back into the team because of media pressure, Waqar said.On Umar Akmal, Waqar described him as an indiscipline player. Akmal was asked by Haroon Rasheed (former chief selector) to come the next day for fitness test to join the team in Sri Lanka for ODIs.Instead he chose to catch a flight to Caribbean for a lucrative league without informing anyone.

The decision was given through a referral.Shehzad, who seemed in elegant touch, smacked two sixes and seven fours in his fiery 45-ball knock.Shehzad finished the event as the highest scorer with 372 runs, including three fifties and a superb 143.Younis promoted left-handed all-rounder Zohaib Khan (12) in the batting order but he departed early. Shoaib Malik had Zohaib caught at deep square-leg by Amad Butt when he attempted a slog sweep.Zohaib, who struggled against Malik, faced 27 deliveries.Fakhar was held at short mid-on by substitute Asif Ali off Test pacer Ehsan Adil after the Mardan-born player had cracked the fourth century of his career.Fakhar hit Shoaib for a four towards mid-off to complete his hundred.

"DUBAI: South Africa have dropped to No. 6 in the Test rankings, while Pakistan have climbed to third place, in the annual update released by the ICC on Tuesday.Australia have taken a six-point lead over second-placed India, while Pakistan trail India by only one point.England and New Zealand benefited from South Africa's drop, moving to fourth and fifth respectively. West Indies retained their eighth-place ranking but lead Bangladesh by only eight points.South Africa and West Indies lost the most points in the update, 17 and 11 respectively. The calculation process dropped results from 2012-13, while outcomes from 2014-15 were weighted at 50%. Only the latest results had 100% weightage. As a result, South Africa's series victories over England, Australia, New Zealand and Pakistan in 2012-13 were not factored in. They lost series to India and England and drew with Bangladesh in the 2015-16 season. West Indies had beaten New Zealand, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe in 2012-13 but lost to Australia and Sri Lanka in 2015-16.The update favoured Pakistan, because their 2-0 loss to Sri Lanka in August 2014 was weighted at 50%. In terms of points gained, Bangladesh made the most progress, getting ten points, followed by Australia, who gained six.Zimbabwe, ranked No. 10, have 12 points but were not included in the rankings table released by the ICC on Tuesday because they had not completed the required eight Tests in the new rating period.

"LONDON: Amir Khan will have to produce one of the greatest displays ever seen by a British boxer if he is to beat WBC middleweight champion Saul Alvarez in Las Vegas on Saturday, according to Ricky Hatton.The 29-year-old, like fellow Briton Hatton a former light-welterweight world champion, has moved up two weight divisions - putting on the best part of 10 kilos - to take on flame-haired Mexican Alvarez, whose only defeat in 48 fights came against Floyd Mayweather Jr in 2013.Khan is a huge underdog against Alvarez, nicknamed Canelo (the Spanish word for cinnamon) because of his hair, but Hatton believes he could pull off an upset.""Its a big ask. He has the tools to do it and I hope he does it, but its a massive, massive ask to keep out of trouble for 12 rounds against Alvarez who has improved so much since the Mayweather fight,"" Hatton told Reuters.""If he does pull it off, going from welterweight to middleweight and winning the title, it would be one of the best wins in British boxing history I think. ""Hatton knows firsthand the dangers of moving up a weight.He suffered his first career defeat when Mayweather knocked him out in a WBC welterweight world title bout in Las Vegas in 2007 and was never the same fighter again.According to the 37-year-old Hatton, who is now a boxing promoter having hung up his gloves in 2012, Khan must not get involved in a slug fest with the more powerful Alvarez and use his superior movement to stay out of trouble?""Its a fight that I didnt think would be made,"" said Hatton, whose stable includes upcoming British heavyweight Nathan Gorman.""Amir always has good fights, but he needs to make this one boring.""If he tries to have a go with this lad, I dont think he needs me to tell him, he needs to use his speed, move, move.The moment he stops moving those feet, he will be in trouble because Alvarez is a big puncher.""Hattons concern is that by putting on some extra pounds to move up, Khan may have slowed down for what will be his first fight in a year since beating American Chris Algieri.""I dont think its the hand speed.

"Leicester City have the chance of making anything between 150 million pounds and 250 million pounds from their sensational Premier League triumph, according to sports marketing experts.The city of Leicester in England's Midlands should also expect to enjoy a huge commercial boost after its hometown team wrote the unlikeliest of sporting success stories, one that has captured headlines around the world.Yet though the club known as the Foxes will gain this substantial windfall, they still have a long way to go to join the true big-money elite of world football.The club that had never won the top-flight crown in its history will cash in through the 90 million pounds in prize money from the Premier League, and money from competing in Europe's Champions League next season, as well as increased TV and match day revenue.With Leicester's increasing attraction to sponsors as the champions of the Premier League, which possesses remarkable global appeal, it could all be worth as much as 150 million pounds to the club, said the sports and entertainment intelligence firm, Repucom, on Tuesday.Other experts have put the estimates much higher with some British media reports suggesting that the figure could be much nearer 250 million pounds, particularly if Leicester's success proves to be more than a one-season wonder.Leicester's TV audiences have soared by over 23% globally this season and because of the excitement inspired by their run to the title, audiences in the UK have grown from 785,000 to over one million per game.In Italy, the numbers watching Leicester's games have doubled, largely thanks to the interest generated by the club being managed by Italian coach Claudio Ranieri.""Leicester's media values have jumped by 30 percent globally whilst in the U.S. they have grown by over 70 percent, showing first-hand the increase in value to current and potential sponsors,"" Repucom said.Leicester's first appearance in the lucrative Champions League will also make a vast difference to their coffers in the region of 36 million pounds.As well as increased TV exposure, it will generate increased revenues from group stage fees, a proportion of the competition's market pool and a participation bonus, totalling 33 million pounds, as well as 3 million pounds performance bonus.A story which had echoes of Leicester's triumph was Atletico Madrid's breaking of the Barcelona-Real Madrid duopoly to win La Liga in 2014.Based on the increased match day and commercial revenues that unlikely champions Atletico gleaned, Leicester can expect to see between 10 to 15 million pounds boost in that area.""Leicester City FC's real commercial potential will become clearer in the season break as brands vie to associate themselves to the club,"" Spencer Nolan, head of consulting at Repucom, said.So, much will depend, in the mid to long-term on how successful the club, owned by Thailand billionaire Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, are in developing their fan base.Though their victory was greeted enthusiastically in Thailand, where Srivaddhanaprabha's family runs the duty-free empire King Power, their fan base is still not in the same league as the historic elite of the English game like Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool.Meanwhile, Leicester itself hopes for an economic boon, with the local newspaper, Leicester Mercury, reporting that financial experts believe the overall economy in the city could benefit to the tune of 49 million pounds.The numbers of visitors to the city have grown rapidly since the discovery of the remains of King Richard III in 2012 and now tourism chiefs hope that being the home of England's football champions will prove a draw card for Leicester too.",05-04-2016,Leicester stand to gain up to 250 million pound windf,football,Leicester City,Claudio Ranieri;Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha;Nolan;Richard III;Spencer Nolan;Srivaddhanaprabha;III;Spencer;Ranieri;Vichai;Claudio;Richard,,Leicester;Leicester City FC;Atletico Madrid;Repucom;King Power;Arsenal;Manchester United;Premier League;Atletico;Barcelona-Real Madrid

"NEW DELHI: India, a country notoriously slow to adopt new ideas, has now embraced the concept of day-night test matches and it will surely not be long before twilight five-day games are a regular feature on the sub-continent.India and Pakistan are set to play floodlit tests this year while Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are considering following suit pending the results of domestic trials.Indias all powerful board of control, the BCCI, has traditionally been suspicious of anything new and ensured the worlds second most populous nation was the last of the major cricketing powers to embrace the Twenty20 format of the game.That embrace has quickly turned into a passionate love affair courtesy of the Indian Premier League (IPL) but the BCCI is still resisting the Decision Review System (DRS) with all its considerable might.It insists it will not accept the technology, which is aimed at reducing umpiring howlers, until it is foolproof.As a result DRS are not used in any bilateral series involving India.The commercial prospects of day-night tests, however, have not been lost on the worlds richest cricket board and it announced last month it would host a floodlit test against New Zealand when the Black Caps tour later this year.BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur said the controversial pink ball used in such contests would be trialled in the domestic Duleep Trophy to help captain Virat Kohli and his team prepare for the day-nighter.""There are lots of factors that need to be taken into account.Things like dew factor, how the spinners bowl with the pink Kookaburra (ball) on Indian pitches,"" Thakur said.The dates and venues of the series against New Zealand have yet to be confirmed but Kolkatas Eden Gardens has been put forward as a possible venue by Cricket Association of Bengal president and former India captain Sourav Ganguly.""We want to play host to a pink-ball test in the future,"" said Ganguly.""We will try to host a local four-day match with the pink ball under the floodlights as a test.""Turnout for test matches in India generally lags far behind the full houses that can be expected for one-day internationals and some IPL fixtures.Even those in the BCCI suspicious of change, therefore, were enthused by what they saw at Adelaide Oval last November when Australia and New Zealand played out the first floodlit test.strong>PICTURESQUE GROUND</strongThe match only lasted only three days, hence the controversy over the pink ball, but attracted more than 123,000 fans through the gates at the picturesque ground as the hosts clinched the trans-Tasman series.The Adelaide turnout looked even more impressive at a time when the games longest format is grappling with dwindling crowds amid the many burgeoning Twenty20 leagues springing up across the cricketing globe.Even Sri Lanka, who turned down Pakistans proposal to play a day-night test in 2013 citing their inexperience with the pink ball, are now considering the option.""We are looking at it very positively,"" Sri Lanka Cricket secretary Mohan de Silva told Reuters.""We are gearing ourselves for the eventuality.The ICC (International Cricket Council) has cleared it and (at some point), wed also fall in line.""The ICC approved day-night tests in 2012 after successful trials of pink balls in Australia, England, Pakistan and South Africa.Pakistan will play a day-night test in Australia in December and might play one before that, against West Indies in October, provided the Caribbean nations agree to the proposal.Another Asian team, Bangladesh, are being a little more cautious about dipping their toes into the water.New Zealand have proposed hosting a day-nighters when Bangladesh visit the country in December and England want to play a twilight test during their tour of the South Asian country in October-November, a Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official told Reuters.""We have not decided on either of the proposals yet,"" BCB media and communication committee chairman Mohammed Jalal Yunus said.""We trialled the pink ball here but there were some issues regarding the shine and durability.We need to address those issues before taking a decision.",05-10-2016,India day night test match Asi,cricket,NEW DELHI,Anurag;Jalal;Trophy;de;Mohan;Silva;Thakur;Mohammed;Anurag Thakur;Yunus;Ganguly;Virat Kohli;Mohan de Silva;Duleep Trophy;Kohli;Duleep;Sourav Ganguly;Mohammed Jalal Yunus;Sourav;Virat,Asi,Black Caps;Bangladesh Cricket Board;Kookaburra;ICC;Cricket Association of Bengal;Reuters;Indian Premier League;International Cricket Council;BCCI
DHAKA: Bangladesh lifted a ban on disgraced fast bowler Shahadat Hossain Tuesday allowing him to play domestic matches weeks after he apologised for torturing an 11 year old girl he employed as a maid.Hossain was banned from all forms of cricket last year by the Bangladesh Cricket Board after he became a subject of investigation for alleged criminal offence which drew huge media interest.The BCB said Hossain was now free to play domestic cricket including the lucrative Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) after he made an emotional appeal seeking a return to cricket.He however will not be considered for national team selection until his legal issues are settled BCB chief executive Nizamuddin Chowdhury said adding the ban was lifted on humanitarian considerations.Hossain who has denied abusing the girl in the past apologised on April 28 for what he called his misdeed and said he had made a mistake.I regret the unwarranted incident I was involved in and apologise to the whole nation the cricketer said in an emotional statement.Bangladeshi police charged the 29 year old pacer and his wife Nritto Shahadat with charges of assault and torture last year after the young girl was found crying on a roadside her eyes bruised and swollen.The couple went into hiding after police raided their house in September when the girl complained that they had beaten and tortured her.Television footage showed her frail and thin looking appearance and police said one of her hands had been burnt with a hot cooking paddle.Hossain spent two months in custody after he handed himself in to police on October 5 and has since been released on bail as was his wife.A judge has ordered that the couple would face trial and if convicted they would face up to 14 years in jail.But a source said the couple and the girl s family may agree to a financial settlement that would see her withdrawing the allegations.,05-10-2016,Bangladesh ban torture shame cricketer,cricket,DHAKA,Nritto Shahadat;Nizamuddin;Chowdhury;Shahadat;Nizamuddin Chowdhury;Shahadat Hossain;Hossain;Nritto,,BCB;Bangladesh Cricket Board;Bangladesh Premier League;BPL

"MELBOURNE: Australias cricket board will make it compulsory for players to wear helmets when facing fast and medium-paced bowling in line with recommendations from a review into the death of Test batsman Phillip Hughes.Wicketkeepers and players fielding close to the wicket will also have to wear helmets in first class matches in accordance with the David Curtain review, which was released on Wednesday.The helmets, mandatory in games and during practice, must adhere to the highest British standard, Cricket Australia (CA) said.Hughes was struck on the back of the head by a rising delivery when batting for South Australia in a domestic match in November 2014.He died two days later in a Sydney hospital aged 25.""Theres not a day that goes by where we dont think of Phillip,"" CA boss James Sutherland told reporters at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Wednesday.""This report wont bring him back and it wont do anything to ease the pain of his family or his loved ones who miss him most.""But we have a responsibility and a duty to ensure nothing like this ever happens again.""Hughess death shocked the cricketing world and ignited a debate about safety standards, particularly for batsmen, who face fast bowling that can exceed 150 kilometres per hour (93 mph).Hughes was wearing an Australian standard helmet when he was struck but the Curtain report said even the newer British standard helmet available at the time would not have afforded him extra protection from the blow.The report also said an apparent delay in the arrival of the ambulance team that treated Hughes played no part in his death.""I am of the opinion the attention received by Phillip after being struck had no role whatsoever on his subsequent demise, due to the nature and severity of his injury,"" it said.The report also recommended wicketkeepers play with protective eye-wear but stopped short of endorsing the clip-on neck guards on the back of helmets, which some players have worn after Hughess death.Sutherland said CA still encouraged players to wear the guards but conceded, like the report, that more research was required to determine whether they actually increased safety.""Were certainly taking up the running on that to make sure we understand it better,"" he said.Sutherland said the board had also sought approval from the International Cricket Council to trial the use of injury substitutes who could bat and bowl in domestic games.Substitutes have been permitted to replace injured or ill players in matches for over 100 years but are not allowed to bat, bowl or act as wicketkeepers or captains, according to the laws of the game.Initially the substitutes would replace players ruled out by concussion but in future their use could be expanded to include other forms of injury, Sutherland added.",05-11-2016,Australia toughens helmet standards after Hughes revi,cricket,MELBOURNE,Hughes.Wicketkeepers;James Sutherland;Hughes;James;Phillip Hughes.Wicketkeepers;Sutherland;Phillip,,International Cricket Council;David Curtain

"MEXICO CITY: FIFA unveiled the timetable of its delayed bidding process for the 2026 World Cup on Tuesday, with president Gianni Infantino's plans for a 40-team tournament to be decided upon by October and a final decision on the hosts to be made in May 2020.Football's world governing body said it would consider giving the green light to joint bids and review a rule which currently allows a continent to stage the tournament every eight years.A FIFA source said they had considered increasing this wait period to 12 years or more and that there had been no discussions about allowing a continent to host successive World Cups.This could mean that with Russia hosting the 2018 World Cup, Europe would have to wait until at least 2030 before staging the tournament again.The decisions were among the first passed by the new-look FIFA Council, which was holding its maiden meeting since it replaced the old executive committee under reforms passed in February.The Council, which has a strategic role, ruled that bidding nations would have to meet requirements on human rights, sustainable event management and environmental protection. Bidders who did not meet ""technical requirements"" would be excluded, it said.Infantino was elected as FIFA president in February when one of his main promises was to increase the number of teams in the finals from 32 to 40, a proposal which is strongly opposed by Europe's biggest clubs.FIFA said that decisions were expected by October on the number of teams, the format for the tournament, the ""eligibility of (continental) confederations to bid"" and whether to allow joint bids.Joint bids were banned in 2011 but Infantino has said he wants to encourage them, possibly spreading the tournament around several countries in a region.strong>CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION</strongFIFA said that a ""consultation process"", outlining new standards for bidders, would run until May 2017, followed by a preparation phase running until December 2018 when countries would have to submit their bids.The bids would be evaluated from January 2019 to February 2020 with a final decision three months later.FIFA was forced to reform its bidding process after the vote in December 2010 awarded the 2018 and 2022 tournaments to Russia and Qatar respectively.That vote is the subject of a criminal investigation by Swiss authorities, while Qatar's preparations have also been marred by allegations of abuse of migrant workers in the construction industry. Qatar says it is working to solve the issue.Under revised statutes, the hosts will be chosen by the 209 members of FIFA at its annual Congress. The Council, however, will still draw up a shortlist of three candidates. Previously, hosting rights were decided by the old executive committee.FIFA said that Gibraltar and Kosovo's applications for membership would be submitted to the Congress on Friday and that both would be allowed to take part in the 2018 World Cup qualifying competition if accepted.Benin was suspended with immediate effect due to legal interference in the country's football federation.

I do not believe the new helmet would have afforded additional protection against the blow given the location of where Phillip was struck, as the protection to the neck, at the rear, is no different.""The report also said the slow arrival of the ambulance that provided medical treatment to the test cricketer played no part in his death.""Although there was apparently a delay in the ambulance arriving, Phillip was being cared for appropriately in the interim,"" it added.""I am of the opinion the attention received by Phillip after being struck had no role whatsoever on his subsequent demise, due to the nature and severity of his injury.""Hughess death shocked the cricketing world and ignited a debate about safety standards, particularly for batsmen, who can face fast bowling that exceeds 150 kilometres per hour (93 mph).The report recommended that all first class cricketers should be required to wear the highest British standard (BS 7928:2013) helmets available when batting against fast and medium pace bowling in matches and during practice.It also recommended wicketkeepers keeping up to the stumps should wear helmets and protective eye-wear. Players fielding close to the stumps, excluding slips fieldsmen, should also wear helmets, the report said.The report noted that more international players had adopted the use of stem guards, which are attached across the back of the helmet, as ""they see it providing additional safety"".""I would recommend that this device be properly evaluated for functionality and comfort as well as to determine if it materially increases player safety, before making any recommendation as to its use,"" it said.Cricket Australia (CA) said it had received the Curtain review last year and would enact new safety measures.<br/>""The global cricket community was deeply saddened by the tragic death of Phillip Hughes and the great loss his family suffered,"" CA CEO James Sutherland said.""We have been considering (Curtains) recommendations and discussing with relevant bodies as to how we best make changes necessary to prevent an accident of this nature happening again.""While there will always be a small risk we believe that the measures we have already taken and will enact following this review will reduce that risk even further.",05-11-2016,Safer helmet would not have saved Phillip Hughes repor,cricket,MELBOURNE,James Sutherland;Hughes;James;David Curtain;Curtain;Sutherland;David;Phillip Hughes;Phillip,Phillip Hughes,Sheffield Shield

"KHARTOUM: Sweat drips from Arafat Abkars brow as she dodges blows in an open-air arena in Khartoums searing summer heat. Wearing only shorts and a t-shirt, the 22-year-old draws crowds in a country where Muslim mores mean womens boxing is a rare spectacle.""When I train, more spectators watch because womens boxing is new and unfamiliar in Sudan,"" Abkar said proudly at the private Nile Club in the south of the city.Sudan is ruled by Islamic law, which requires women to dress modestly. Most families are not so supportive and another girl at the club said she boxed in secret as her family would object to her taking part in what they see as a mans sport.Womens boxing was unheard of in Sudan until four years ago, when Sahar Mohamed took up the sport and represented her country at the All Africa Games last year. She was defeated on points in the Middleweight category by Yannick Azangue of Cameroon.Since then, the Sudan Amateur Boxing Federation has sought to encourage women to join the sport despite social challenges.""Four years ago, I was the first Sudanese girl to box and I faced big pressures from my family and people but Ill continue as this is my lifes dream,"" said Mohamed at a state-run youth centre in Khartoum, where she trains.Nearby, two women were training alongside men, shouting as they jumped from foot to foot and punched each other with worn gloves. The equipment is worn and basic, but the centre is busy, the atmosphere buzzing with young people practicing everything from martial arts to soccer.""People watch satellite channels and look on the internet and that has changed the culture and given new courage to women in the past few years to pick up boxing gloves,"" Mohamed Yousef, head of the Sudanese national boxing team, said.""The Sudan Boxing Federation asked us put more emphasis on girls to encourage them to continue in the sport.

"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's newly appointed coach Mickey Arthur feels that dearth of international cricket at home has damaged Pakistan cricket and termed it as one of the reasons behind Pakistans decline in the game.The former Australia and South Africa coach said that Pakistani batsmen will have to play an important role to achieve results for the team.Pakistan is playing all the cricket outside the country. Every time they play it is an away series which is really hard. It is always difficult playing outside your condition and it has dented Pakistan cricket, in an exclusive interview with a private news channel Arthur said.The South African-born coach said that he picked up the role of coaching Pakistan team considering it as a big challenge and that he was looking forward to deliver results but demanded consistency in team decisions for any positive outcome.I think its a great challenge. Pakistan cricket has struggled a little bit in the last couple of years and certainly I am keen to bring it back to its rightful place in the ranking and the rightful place in world cricket, he said.Talking about his first assignment with Pakistan team, the tour of England, Arthur said that the series will be a big challenge for the players and key will be to learn how to perform outside the United Arab Emirates, where Pakistan has been playing most of its cricket recently.Pakistan has got a wonderful group of bowlers. We need to work on batting, particularly outside the UAE, and that will be key. Also we need to bring the fielding up to standards of international level, he added.It will be a challenge for players that how they are going to handle the conditions outside the UAE and Pakistan. You need your batsmen to step up and score runs.<br/> So technically we need to work really hard to get our batting 100 percent right, said 47-year-old former cricketer.During Arthurs coaching stint, South Africa reached the top in all the three formats.Arthur said he is confident that Pakistan can also achieve the top position but warned that it can be achieved only if there is consistency in team decisions.<br/> You need opportunity and time to build the team in order to achieve the result.<br/> We need to be consistent with our selections, we need to be consistent with our players and we need to allow players to express themselves without any consequences.Thats the key, players need to find out how they go about and play in certain situations. I hope we can give the players that experience and make sure they go forward, he said.Arthur said he did not feel any language barrier while working with Pakistani players during the Pakistan Super League earlier this year, where he coached the team Karachi Kings but added that he would still look to have a local coach as his assistant so that his message is not lost in translation.I will have a local coach as my assistant who can deliver my message to the guys.<br/> That is quite important. But language barrier wasnt a problem in PSL and I hope it wont be a problem while coaching Pakistan as well, he said.Sharing his PSL experience Arthur said that his experience of working with Pakistani players was excellent as they pose immense talent.I was very impressed with the talent in the PSL. There were very good young and useful players. I think with the right guidance and environment, these guys can become very very good players.Their skill level is very high, he said.Arthur, who is currently in Perth, said he will join the Pakistan team by the end of this month.",5/13/2016,Lack of international games denting Pakistan cricket says Arthur,cricket,ISLAMABAD,Mickey;Arthur;Mickey Arthur,Arthur;Mickey Arthur,Karachi Kings;PSL

"MEXICO CITY: A few steps from the entrance to Mexico City's imposing Presidente Hotel, where FIFA delegates are staying during this week's Congrees, a boy of around 10-years-old sells tamarind balls covered in chili powder from a cart for 10 Mexican pesos ($0.55) each.The spicy, tangy sweets are a local specialty yet are unlikely to have been tasted by the FIFA delegates. The guests of world soccer are more likely to be inside sipping lattes for eight times the price.FIFA has often been known for lavishing a five-star lifestyle on its delegates and officials. When former president Sepp Blatter went to an event in Zurich with the city's mayor, he arrived in a chauffeur-driven limousine while the politician came and went by tram.But after Gianni Infantino was elected president of soccer's scandal-plagued body in February, one of his first pledges was to make FIFA more humble, suggesting, among other things, that federation officials no longer wore suits to matches.The early signs were promising as he flew to Britain for his first official engagement by a budget airline rather than the private plane favoured by his predecessor.But this week's Congress in Mexico City has looked as extravagant as any held under Blatter.FIFA confirmed that it paid all the expenses for each of its 209 member associations to bring a three-man delegation, flying business class and staying in five-star accommodation. Each delegate was also given $1,000 in spending money.LEAVE THE BUBBLERooms at the Presidente are booked for about $400 a night. Members of the FIFA Council, the world governing body's board, are staying at the plusher Four Seasons hotel where rooms typically cost $675 a night, according to hotel booking websites.FIFA sources told Reuters that efforts were being made to persuade delegates to leave their bubble but having them walk a few hundred yards took some effort.Some were seen walking the 500 metres from their hotel to Thursday's opening ceremony at the city's 10,000-seat National Auditorium, considered one of the world's best entertainment venues.It was seen by FIFA as a step, albeit it a small one, in the right direction, although others insisted on taking a luxury bus.The night before, FIFA seemed as detached as ever when their so-called Legends team of former international footballers took part in an exhibition match at Mexico City's historic Azteca stadium.FIFA billed it as a ""football fiesta"" and said it was ""engaging more with the football world and getting football back to the heart of FIFA, It was closed to the public.It was witnessed only by specially invited guests who spent most of the evening in a tent built onto the pitch, where they were pampered with wine, champagne and canapes, while traditional Mexican dances were performed on a stage.Privately, FIFA sources said the event had been hastily arranged and had not been what they intended.Infantino, who has vowed to cut costs, was somewhat vague when asked about it at a media conference on Friday, though he said it was something FIFA could look into.""I think it's always been the case that they are paid $1,000 as a fee for the delegates, it's part of the budget approved by the finance committee,"" he said.""It's good that it's been raised and we might have a look at it.""",5/14/2016,FIFA five star lifestyle Mexico City,football,MEXICO CITY,Blatter;Sepp;Gianni;Sepp Blatter;Gianni Infantino;Infantino,,Congress;FIFA Council;Reuters;FIFA

""On the other hand, we need to protect our associations from government interference, it is one of our major tasks.""The Kuwait FA (KFA) was suspended by FIFA in October after soccer's governing body said a draft sports law constituted interference in the nation's football association.",5/14/2016,FIFA allows Indonesia back to global tab,football,MEXICO CITY,Gianni;Gianni Infantino;Infantino,,FIFA Congress;FIFA Council;AFC Executive Committee;PSSI;FIFA

"DUBAI: The ICC has opened discussions with broadcasters about organising World Twenty20 tournaments in 2018 and 2022, thus the event will be played every two years.This means two extra World Cups will be added to the existing schedule as it looks to cash in on the booming popularity of the games shortest format.After the success of the World Twenty20 in India recently, the ICC does not want to wait another four years for the next tournament, which is due to be staged in Australia in 2020.This was proposed at the ICC recent board meeting in Dubai about holding a World Twenty20 every two years with West Indies a possibility for the proposed 2018 tournament and the UAE in 2022. The proposal is expected to be added to the agenda for the ICCs annual general meeting in Edinburgh at the end of June for formal discussion.An informal sounding out of broadcasters has begun about adding the tournaments to the recent $2?billion (1.4?billion) rights deal signed with Star Sports in 2014 that runs until 2023. That deal included a World Twenty20 this year and in 2020 after the ICC decided to place its three global tournaments (the World Cup, Champions Trophy and World Twenty20) on a four year cycle.But the collapse of the Twenty20 Champions League, which featured domestic teams from around the world, has left a hole in the calendar in September-October, a time which is suitable for cricket in seven of the nine Test playing nations.Sources have confirmed the ICC has explored the possibility of holding the mens World Twenty20 in the West Indies in 2018, possibly as a run in or at the same as the womens version is due to take place in the Caribbean. But the problem with the Caribbean is the time difference makes it incompatible with the Indian market, where the vast broadcast deals are on offer.Another possibility is South Africa, although the government there recently banned its cricket board from hosting global tournament because it had failed to meet racial quotas. The UAE has the infrastructure to host the tournament and the time difference works well with India. England is a non starter because this country is already hosting the 2017 Champions Trophy and 2019 World Cup.The recent World Twenty20 was hailed by the ICC for bringing in record television ratings. The group match between Pakistan and India was watched by 83?million people and in this country the pulsating final between England and West Indies brought Sky Sports a peak of 2.45?million viewers, the channels highest rating for a cricket match.Tweets about the World Twenty20 received 5.75?billion impressions and the ICC claimed 46?million people engaged with the tournament on Facebook.

"Andy Murray enjoyed the perfect 29th birthday present on Sunday, puncturing Novak Djokovic's air of dominance by beating the out-of-sorts Serb in straight sets in the final of the Italian Open in Rome.Just a week after Djokovic had beaten him in the final of the Madrid Open, the Scot gained his revenge over the world number one in another claycourt final with a superb 6-3 6-3 win in one hour and 35 minutes.Djokovic was not at his best and in a grumpy mood, complaining on several occasions to the umpire about the slippery court surface on a damp day at the Foro Italico.Yet the defeat, just his third of the entire season, could not be totally put down to hints of weariness from Djokovic after a tough week's work as he told Murray afterwards: ""Well done Andy, you were just too good.""It was an emphatic triumph, after finishing runner-up in Madrid and making the semi-finals in Monte Carlo, to convince Murray that he now must have his best shot yet at winning the French Open, which begins next weekend.In the week that Murray announced an amicable split from coach Amelie Mauresmo, this was only the second time in their last 14 meetings that he had beaten Djokovic and it was his first victory in their six duels on clay.The light rain in the Italian capital really seemed to dampen Djokovic's spirit as he complained to the umpire that it was ""too dangerous"" to continue but his appeals were brushed aside by the official, Damian Steiner.Murray was aggressive from the start, taking command in the light drizzle, and even when Djokovic appeared to be fighting back in the second set, Murray saved break points in successive games to begin imposing himself again.At the end, Djokovic capitulated with surprising swiftness, hitting a couple of errant forehands and a double fault at 3-5 down before Murray conjured up one inspirational backhand winner from way beyond the tramlines to lift the title.No British man had won the Italian title since Patrick Hughes in 1931 and the triumph will put Murray into the world number two spot on Monday ahead of Roger Federer before the second of the season's slams starts in Paris.",5/16/2016,Djokovic suffers rare loss as Murray takes Rome ti,tennis,,Federer;Hughes;Murray;Amelie;Novak;Roger;Andy Murray;Amelie Mauresmo;Djokovic;Damian Steiner.Murray;Roger Federer;Steiner.Murray;Patrick;Mauresmo;Damian;Novak Djokovic;Andy;Patrick Hughes,Djokovic;Murray;Novak Djokovic;Andy Murray,

"LEEDS: A diligent half-century from Alex Hales, coupled with some home-ground know-how from Jonny Bairstow, helped England to regroup with a 88-run stand for the sixth wicket on the first day of the first Test against Sri Lanka, after their ambitions had been dramatically dented by the loss of five wickets for 34 runs either side of the lunch break.By tea, Hales was unbeaten on 71, his second Test half-century in nine innings and his highest yet, beating the 60 he made against South Africa at Cape Town in January.At the other end was Bairstow, who arrived at the crease with England's innings in crisis at 83 for 5, but responded with the sort of sparky counter-punching. Bairstow's 54 not out from 67 balls took the attack back to Sri Lanka, who nevertheless remained firmly in the contest at 171 for 5, thanks to Dasun Shanaka's sensational debut breakthroughs.After being put into bat on a morning when bowling first was a no-brainer for both captains, England's openers were obliged to rein in the extravagant strokeplay that has coloured so much of their cricket in recent months - a situation that might have been tailor-made for Alastair Cook. He began the match needing another 36 runs to reach 10,000 Test runs, and after getting off the mark with a sixth-ball clip for four through midwicket, appeared well set for the long grind until Shanaka's introduction, in the 18th over of the day, tore up the pre-conceived script.Shanaka launched his Test career with a maiden before striking with the first ball of his second over. Cook had been leaving the ball with his usual sangfroid for most of his 52 deliveries, but having creamed one cover drive off Nuwan Pradeep, he was drawn into another from the slower, wobblier Shanaka. The full length outside off left him a touch, and Cook scuffed an edge through to Dinesh Chandimal, the keeper. He was gone for 16, and still needs another 20 runs to notch up a landmark that has been on his conscience since the start of the South Africa tour in December.Three balls later, however, such thoughts had been whisked out of England's minds. Nick Compton - whose anxieties cannot have been aided by his team-mates' struggles to impose themselves - poked with caution at a perfect off-stump line and length, to squeeze a low edge through to Lahiru Thirimanne at first slip. He was gone for a duck as Shanaka became only the third bowler in Test history, and the first since Richard Johnson in 2003, to claim two wickets before conceding his first career run.And, as if that was not enough of an impact on debut, Shanaka then added England's main man to his tally, as Joe Root - in such golden touch in all formats - was also drawn into a drive that scudded to Kusal Mendis at third slip.It was a dream start for Shanaka, who had been awarded his Test cap by Mahela Jayawardene before the start of play, and a timely boost for a beleaguered Sri Lanka squad too, who began the match knowing that Dhammika Prasad, their matchwinning seamer on this ground two years ago, will miss the whole Test series after flying home to resolve a shoulder injury.By tea, however, Hales and Bairstow had provided their team with a steadying hand, as a forecast rain shower swept in from the Pennines to delay the resumption of play.",5/19/2016,Hales Bairstow rescue England with 88 run unbeaten stand,cricket,LEEDS,Jonny Bairstow;Prasad;Kusal;Dhammika Prasad;Hales;Chandimal;Cook;Richard Johnson;Mahela;Alastair;Kusal Mendis;Nick Compton;Dhammika;Richard;Dasun Shanaka;Alastair Cook;Nuwan;Alex;Lahiru;Bairstow;Dasun;Johnson;Compton;Nuwan Pradeep;Nick;Thirimanne;Pradeep;Mahela Jayawardene;Jonny;Shanaka;Dinesh Chandimal;Dinesh;Alex Hales;Jayawardene;Lahiru Thirimanne;Mendis,Hales Bairstow,
"LEEDS: Alastair Cooks bid to become the first England batsman to reach 10,000 Test runs had been relegated to an afterthought by lunch on the first morning of the first Test at Headingley, as the Sri Lanka debutant Dasun Shanaka claimed three wickets for one run in the space of eight balls to cut a swathe through England's much-heralded top order.By lunch, Cook had been dismissed for 16 - still 20 runs shy of his landmark - with Nick Compton and Joe Root, the local hero and newly-crowned England Test player of the year, both following for ducks in a sensational ten-minute spell before lunch.It was left to Alex Hales, who had been growing in confidence on 38 after an anxious first hour, and England's own debutant, James Vince, to glue the innings together. Vince had yet to get off the mark after 15 balls of watchful defence, as England settled for a lunchtime scoreline - and a definite bout of indigestion - of 57 for 3.Shanaka had been brought on to bowl the 19th over of the innings with England apparently looking solid on 44 for 0 after Cook and Hales had seen off the new-ball danger of Shaminda Eranga and Nuwan Pradeep.Instead, having launched his Test career with a maiden, Shanaka struck with his seventh delivery to tempt Cook with a fuller length outside off, and scuffed an edge through to Dinesh Chandimal, the keeper.Then, three balls later, Compton poked with caution at a perfect off-stump line and length, to squeeze a low edge through to Lahiru Thirimanne at first slip.Shanaka then added England's main man to his tally, as Root - in such golden touch in all formats - was also drawn into a drive as Shanaka's wobbly medium-pace left his shot just a fraction and scudded to Kusal Mendis at third slip instead.It was a dream start for Shanaka and a timely boost for a beleaguered Sri Lanka squad too, who began the match knowing that Dhammika Prasad, their matchwinning seamer on this ground two years ago, will miss the whole Test series after flying home to resolve a shoulder injury.The second hour of the session also featured a lively but unsuccessful introduction for Sri Lanka's pacy young quick bowler, Dushmantha Chameera, as well as a typically accurate probe from the spinner, Rangana Herath, whose solitary over was blocked out for a maiden by Hales before the break.Both sides are wearing black armbands in recognition of the floods that are currently affecting Sri Lanka.",5/19/2016,Sri Lankas Shanaka debut triple stings England,cricket,LEEDS,Prasad;Shaminda;Chandimal;Alastair Cooks;Rangana;Dushmantha;Nuwan;Joe;Alex;Lahiru;Herath;Compton;Root;Nick;Eranga;Joe Root;Dinesh Chandimal;Nuwan Pradeep.Instead;Lahiru Thirimanne;Mendis;Kusal;Dhammika Prasad;Hales;Cook;Alastair;Kusal Mendis;Dushmantha Chameera;Nick Compton;Dhammika;Dasun Shanaka;Dasun;James;Thirimanne;Rangana Herath;Chameera;Cooks;Vince;Shanaka;Dinesh;Shaminda Eranga;Alex Hales;James Vince;Pradeep.Instead,,LEEDS

"English Premier League champions Leicester City paid a visit to Bangkok's glittering Grand Palace on Thursday and signed a well-wishing book for the country's revered monarch King Bhumibol Adulyadej.The 88-year-old Thai king ascended the throne 70 years ago and is the world's longest-reigning monarch, but various ailments have kept him in hospital for a year.The squad, led by manager Claudio Ranieri and captain Wes Morgan, did not meet the king but gathered with thousands of tourists at one of Bangkok's top spots for visitors.The Thai-owned club are on an end-of-season tour to celebrate their improbable ascendancy to the top of the Premier League following a campaign they started as 5000-1 outsiders for the title but ended as champions by a 10-point margin.Billionaire club owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, who led the party to the Grand Palace, said on Wednesday that he hoped the lessons learned by Leicester in their stunning season could serve to help Thailand's national team to a similar success.""We want to help Thailand go to the World Cup,"" said Vichai, who bought the club in 2010.""Thailand can be at the top, just like Leicester City.""While at the Grand Palace, Vichai placed the Premier League trophy on a flower-decked table in front of an alter dedicated to the king, flanked by his son Aiyawatt and Ranieri.Soccer is hugely popular in the Southeast Asian nation but Thailand have had little success on the world stage.Thailand have never qualified for a World Cup but are one of the remaining 12 Asian teams competing for four spots at the next tournament in Russia 2018.The duty free franchise that has made Vichai one of Thailand's richest man is named King Power, in a reference to King Bhumibol.It is also the name of Leicester's home ground in Britain's Midlands after his company bought the naming rights in 2011 before buying the stadium outright two years later.The team will later hold a victory parade in central Bangkok.",5/19/2016,English champions Leicester visit Thai kings ,football,,Claudio Ranieri;Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha;Wes;Wes Morgan;Srivaddhanaprabha;Morgan;Ranieri;Vichai;Claudio;Bhumibol;Aiyawatt,,Leicester City;Premier League

We're doing a lot of work on it and we'd love to see day-night cricket.""The first floodlit test at Adelaide Oval lasted only three days raising doubts if the pink ball can last the duration of the required number of overs in an innings.But the test also attracted more than 123,000 fans through the gates at the picturesque ground, a welcome sight at a time when the game's longest format is grappling with dwindling crowds with the advent of the shortest Twenty20 format.England has also attempted a minor shake-up by proposing a points-based system to determine the winner of their home series against Sri Lanka beginning on Thursday.The points-based system is aimed at injecting more excitement into the tour and add context to matches that otherwise maybe of merely academic interests.Graves said work needed to be done to make the longest format more exciting and relevant.""We have to make test cricket meaningful and we have to put some 'oomph' behind it,"" Graves said.""Test cricket is safe if we do something about it, but I don't think it is safe if we do nothing.

"A Chinese magnate has agreed to buy historic English football club Aston Villa, the latest in a series of investments from China into football worldwide as President Xi Jinping looks to make the country a global powerhouse in the sport.The deal, reportedly worth 60 million pounds ($88 million), will see the chairman of little-known Recon Group, Xia Jiantong, become the first mainland Chinese to fully own an English team.Under the leadership of Xi, an avid fan, China has made it a goal to one day win the World Cup, and has ploughed huge amounts of investment into grassroots academies, television rights, transfer deals for overseas players and investment in clubs abroad.More broadly, Beijing is aiming to grow the domestic sports market to 5 trillion yuan ($782 billion) by 2025, about five times its current scale.China's biggest overseas investment in football so far occurred in December last year, when a consortium led by state-backed China Media Capital took a $400 million stake in the owner of Villa's far larger and wealthier rival, Manchester City.The Villa deal, however, with 100 percent ownership, is not just an investment.""The Chinese ownership now get to decide how to run the club,"" said Mark Dreyer, Beijing-based founder of sports information website China Sports Insider.Crosstown arch-rivals Birmingham City are also run from Asia, following the 2009 takeover by Hong Kong businessman Carson Yeung.Villa's American owner Randy Lerner, who put the club on the market in 2014, struck the deal after former English champions Villa suffered a miserable season that left them relegated from the country's top football league.Recon Group, Xia's privately owned holding company, owns a controlling interest in five publicly listed companies on the Hong Kong and Chinese stock exchanges.The deal with American-educated Xia, 39, ends an unhappy tenure for Lerner, who bought the midlands club for 62.2 million pounds in 2006. Fans have openly demonstrated against his continued involvement with Villa, who were European champions in 1982 and have won the English top-flight title seven times.The club ended the recent season bottom of the English Premier League table, with only half the number of points of the next worst team.""Aston Villa's relegation really played in their favour,"" said Fredrik van Huynh, Shanghai-based director of HHC Sports Group. ""It will have pushed down the price quite significantly.""Xia, who studied at Harvard University and has a doctorate, took to his official microblog late on Wednesday to wish the club's fans ""health and happiness"".Earlier this month he posted: ""Go, Villa, Go! We will be back.""The club said Xia's immediate objective was ""to return Aston Villa to the Premier League and then to have the club finish in the top six, bringing European football back to Villa Park"".It added the deal would also help make Villa the most famous football club in China.Dreyer at China Sports Insider dismissed that as ""simply ludicrous"", given the appeal of much bigger rivals such as Spain's Barcelona and England's Manchester United and Arsenal.""I think fans of the club will remain sceptical until it becomes clear what his true motivations are,"" he added.($1 = 0.6837 pounds)",5/19/2016,Chinese magnate to buy English soccer team Aston Vi,football,,Villa;Aston;Mark;Huynh;Randy Lerner;Carson Yeung.Villa;Jiantong;Xi;Fredrik;Yeung.Villa;Mark Dreyer;Fredrik van Huynh;Jinping;Xi Jinping;van;Randy;Aston Villa;Dreyer;Xia;Lerner;Xia Jiantong;Carson,,Villa;Manchester City.The Villa;Barcelona;Manchester United and Arsenal;Aston Villa;Harvard University;Recon Group;HHC Sports Group;Premier League;league.Recon Group;China Media Capital
"Sevilla conjured up a dazzling comeback to clinch a record third successive Europa League title on Wednesday, flooring Liverpool with a 3-1 victory that showed why the Spanish side have become masters of Europe's second-tier competition.Sevilla captain Coke lifted the trophy at Basel's St Jakob-Park having been the architect of their heroics, scoring twice to leave Liverpool gasping on the canvas after Kevin Gameiro had cancelled out Daniel Sturridge's opener.It was a remarkable turnaround after Liverpool had dominated the first half so completely that Juergen Klopp's side should have been home and dry, but they failed to inflict further damage when their opponents were reeling.Unai Emery's team hit back with three goals in 25 minutes, the first coming just 17 seconds after the interval, to claim the trophy for the fifth time in 11 seasons and become the first side in 40 years to win three consecutive European competitions.""At Sevilla we love this competition and we love it so much and we want it so much that we won it,"" Emery said. ""It is our competition and we underlined that once again.""For Liverpool and Klopp, who has now suffered successive final defeats in his seven months in charge after February's League Cup disappointment, it was a dispiriting occasion.His team's hopes of Champions League qualification were dashed, leaving Liverpool to face up to a season with no European competition.""The players are still young,"" Klopp told reporters. ""We will use this experience today and someday everyone will say Basel was a decisive moment for Liverpool FC.""It had looked, however, like being an entirely different outcome at the interval.The opening goal arrived after 35 minutes and was a genuine moment of class from Sturridge, who received the ball on the left edge of the area before expertly picking his spot with a pin-point curling finish off the outside of his left boot.The England striker had already had a header hacked off the line and Liverpool had two vociferous penalty appeals for handball waved away by referee Jonas Eriksson as they turned the screw on their opponents.The halftime whistle came to Sevilla's rescue, however, allowing them to regroup before clawing themselves off the ropes with an immediate sucker punch.Seconds had elapsed before Liverpool left back Alberto Moreno, whose mistakes have cost his side on a number of occasions this season, darted hopelessly into a tackle on Mariano Ferreira, who skipped past him and crossed for Gameiro to side-foot into an empty net.Then it was Liverpool's turn to hit the panic button as Gameiro wasted two further chances before Coke added a second after 63 minutes.Vitolo danced through a series of Liverpool tackles before the ball landed invitingly for the Sevilla skipper to curl his finish into the corner.The final nail in Liverpool's coffin sparked fury on the touchline as Coke kept his cool to bury his second goal beneath Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet, only for the linesman to briefly raise his flag before putting it down again.After some pushing and shoving the goal stood, leaving Liverpool with a mountain to climb.Having retreated so far into their shell, however, they were incapable of rising above base camp.",5/19/2016,Canny Sevilla retain iron grip on Europa League trophy,handball,,Juergen;Moreno;Mignolet;Gameiro;Simon Mignolet;Alberto;Eriksson;Ferreira;Simon;Emery;Juergen Klopp;Klopp;Jonas;Jonas Eriksson;Mariano;Daniel;Kevin;Daniel Sturridge;Kevin Gameiro;Sturridge;Alberto Moreno;Mariano Ferreira,,Liverpool FC;Liverpool;Coke;St Jakob-Park;Sevilla
"LEEDS: The England pace attack ripped out Sri Lanka for 91 after Jonny Bairstow made an excellent century to put the hosts in complete control of the first Test on the second day in Leeds on Friday.Bairstows superb knock of 140 lifted England to 298 in their first innings before James Anderson and Stuart Broad took nine wickets between them in favourable conditions for seam bowling at Headingley.England captain Alastair Cook enforced the follow-on and the touring side negotiated two deliveries to reach one for no wicket before bad light ended play. Sri Lanka trail by 206 runs in the opening match of the three-Test series.England had resumed in the morning on 171 for five and Bairstow and Alex Hales extended their sixth-wicket partnership to 141. Hales, on 86, was in sight of his maiden test century when he skied spinner Rangana Herath to deep extra cover.Moeen Ali (nought) and Broad (two) were dismissed by Dushmantha Chameera in the same over but Bairstow, dropped on 70, completed his second Test hundred and celebrated the achievement enthusiastically on his home ground.Bairstow found a solid partner in Steven Finn, the pair adding 56 for the ninth wicket before the former skied a catch to mid-on off Chameera.Sri Lanka made a dreadful start to their reply as experienced fast bowlers Anderson and Broad exploited the conditions superbly.Dimuth Karunaratne, Kaushal Silva and Kusal Mendis all edged catches to wicketkeeper Bairstow, leaving the tourists in deep trouble at 12 for three.Dinesh Chandimal, on 15, was well held by James Vince at third slip off Ben Stokes before Anderson trapped captain Angelo Mathews lbw for 34 and then dismissed Dasun Shanaka first ball that the batsman nicked to Bairstow.Herath was smartly caught by Stokes in the slips off Anderson for one, Chameera (2) drove Broad to Finn at mid-off and Lahiru Thirimanne, on 22, was caught by Finn at mid-on off Broad.Anderson completed his 19th five-wicket haul in Tests and outstanding figures of five for 16 when he had Shaminda Eranga caught by Bairstow down the leg-side.",5/20/2016,Sri Lanka skittled out for 91 in reply to Englands 298,cricket,LEEDS,Jonny Bairstow;Mathews;Shaminda;Angelo;Rangana;Angelo Mathews;Stuart Broad;Dushmantha;Alex;Herath;Lahiru;Bairstow;Silva;Eranga;Steven;Stokes;Broad;Lahiru Thirimanne;Mendis;Finn;Kusal;James Anderson;Hales;Cook;Alastair;Kusal Mendis;Dushmantha Chameera;Ben Stokes;Kaushal Silva;Dasun Shanaka;Alastair Cook;Kaushal;Dasun;James;Thirimanne;Ben;Rangana Herath;Chameera;Anderson;Steven Finn;Karunaratne;Vince;Jonny;Shanaka;Stuart;Shaminda Eranga;Alex Hales;Ali;James Vince,,
"LEEDS: England took command on the second afternoon of the first Test at Headingley after Jonny Bairstow played a brilliant counter-punching innings of 140 and later added three catches behind the stumps. With a total of 298 to defend, Stuart Broad and James Anderson produced another classy display of seam and swing bowling to leave the Sri Lankans rattled on 43 for 3 at tea.It was a situation far removed from the 83-for-5 scoreline that had confronted Bairstow when he walked out to bat shortly after lunch on the first day. And with the new ball jagging alarmingly from a full length as Broad and Anderson brought all of their huge experience to bear, it took a gutsy response from Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal, Sri Lanka's most experienced pairing, to reach the break without further damage.Faced with grey skies and a packed cordon, Sri Lanka's openers, Dimuth Karunaratne and Kaushal Silva betrayed their anxieties in the very first over, when they hesitated so long over a quick single that they could have ended up shaking hands in the middle of the pitch.Instead, they simply waved goodbye in the space of five deliveries as, first, Broad straightened one off the seam to kiss the edge of the left-handed Karunaratne, who departed for a 12-ball duck, before Anderson drew level with Kapil Dev on 434 career wickets by finding some extra lift to dispose of Silva for 11.One over later, and Broad had two wickets in three balls as he went wide on the crease to spear an angled full-length ball into Kusal Mendis' forward defence, for Bairstow to snaffle the slenderest of deflections behind the stumps.Chandimal and Mathews, however, stood firm in a 31-run stand before the interval.The story of the day, however, remained Bairstow's happy homecoming - a second Test century and his first at his Yorkshire home. Continuing the theme that Bairstow and his fellow not-out batsman, Alex Hales, had established on the first afternoon, England's sixth-wicket pair extended their stand to 141 to banish the memories of the top-order wobble, when five wickets had tumbled for 34 runs.At the other end, Hales wound his neck in and banished all risk from his game as he set his sights on the remaining 29 runs he needed for his maiden Test century. But he faced with a change of tempo as Rangana Herath came into the attack, Hales' patience snapped for good. In Herath's second over, he skipped down the track and failed to reach the pitch of the ball with an ambitious wallop over the covers. A fast flat leading edge fizzed out to Dushmantha Chameera at deep extra cover, who pouched the offering with a well-judged dive.If Hales' failing had been to linger too long, then a different criticism could be levelled at Moeen Ali. England's No. 8 had admitted before the match that he had lost a bit of confidence in being slated to come in so low for his country, but the hasty manner in which he came and went didn't exactly enhance his case for a promotion. He had failed to score from his first seven deliveries when he drove too firmly at his eighth, from Chameera, and lobbed a simple catch off the inside edge and pad, to Mendis under the helmet at short leg.It was a timely reward for the slippery Chameera, bowling only his second over of the day. He had erred on the short side in his fruitless first day's work, but was soon celebrating two wickets in the space of five deliveries when Broad drove flat-footedly at a hint of width outside off and spread-eagled his own stumps via an inside edge.Bairstow simply stared down the track, rather nonplussed by the clatter of wickets in his midst. But he didn't have to wait long to reframe the story of the session. From the first ball of Chameera's next over, Bairstow drilled a drive into the covers, paused as a wild shy came in at the non-striker's end, then galloped through with glee as the ball zipped through for overthrows to gift him his second century and his first on home soil.",5/20/2016,England strike against Sri Lanka after Bairstow century,cricket,LEEDS,Jonny Bairstow;Mathews;Chandimal;Angelo;Rangana;Angelo Mathews;Stuart Broad;Kapil;Dushmantha;Alex;Herath;Bairstow;Silva;Moeen Ali;Broad;Dinesh Chandimal;Moeen;Mendis;Kusal;James Anderson;Dimuth;Hales;Dimuth Karunaratne;Kusal Mendis;Dushmantha Chameera;Kaushal Silva;Kaushal;James;Rangana Herath;Chameera;Anderson;Karunaratne;Jonny;Stuart;Kapil Dev;Dev;Dinesh;Alex Hales;Ali,Bairstow;Jonny Bairstow,
"LEEDS: Jonny Bairstow brought up his second Test century, and his first on his home ground at Headingley, as England continued their fightback on the second morning of the first Test against Sri Lanka. However, with Alex Hales falling short in his own quest for three figures, Sri Lanka battled back with three wickets in the second hour of the session, and will be armed with a brand-new ball when play resumes after lunch.Continuing the theme that Hales and Bairstow had established on the first afternoon, the pair extended their sixth-wicket stand to 141 to banish the memories of England's top-order wobble, when five wickets had tumbled for 34 runs. Bairstow was once again the aggressor, as befits a man in supreme form on his Yorkshire home ground - his last two innings at the venue have been 246 and 198.Bairstow outscored his partner by three to one throughout their morning resumption, capitalising on too much width as both Sri Lanka openers, Shaminda Eranga and Nuwan Pradeep, offered opportunities to fillet the third-man boundary. He did enjoy one clear moment of good fortune however, on 70, when Pradeep failed to gather a sharp return catch to his right, as Bairstow scuffed a drive back down the track.At the other end, Hales wound his neck in and banished all risk from his game as he set his sights on the remaining 29 runs he needed for his maiden Test century. It was a grind, as he routinely refused to chase anything outside his eyeline, except for one clear opportunity on 82, when Dimuth Karunaratne failed to cling onto a flying edge at slip off the bowling off Angelo Mathews.It could have been the slice of luck that Hales needed. But four runs later, and faced with a change of tempo as Rangana Herath came into the attack, Hales' patience snapped for good. In Herath's second over, he skipped down the track and failed to reach the pitch of the ball with an ambitious wallop over the covers. A fast flat leading edge fizzed out to Dushmantha Chameera at deep extra cover, who pouched the offering with a well-judged dive.Hales was visibly distraught, lingering at the crease for several seconds and looking as though he wanted to snap his errant bat in two. Though he belatedly acknowledged the crowd as he dragged himself from the field, he knew that he had thrown away a priceless opportunity to silence those who doubt his credentials as a Test match opener.It could have set his summer up at the first opportunity. Instead, having added 15 runs to his overnight 71 in 52 deliveries, with a dropped catch thrown in the mix as well, he will know that the jury remains out. At least, for those of a superstitious bent, he had guaranteed his fate would be different to the last two England openers to make a maiden Test hundred at Headingley - both Sam Robson (2014) and Adam Lyth (2015) were out of the side by the end of the summer.If Hales' failing had been to linger too long, then a different criticism could be levelled at Moeen Ali.

"ISLAMABAD: England and Wales Cricket Board (EWCB) director Andrew Strauss has announced that a points system crossing all formats will be used for the matches against Sri Lanka and Pakistan this summer.The Super Series will get underway when the international summer begins with the first Test between England and Sri Lanka at Headingley on Thursday.As is traditional individual series trophies will still be atstake for the Tests oneday internationals and oneoff Twenty20internationals against both tourists.But a system will also be introduced whereby the sides can earn four points for a Test win, two for a draw and two for a victory in one of the whiteball matches www.skysports.com reported.An overall win may therefore possibly not be achieved until the final match in each series which will be the Twenty20 matches in the case of this summers tours and an unsponsored prize of 25,000 will be put up by the home board. The idea is Strauss own and he outlined the thinking behind it at Headingley on Wednesday.Today Im introducing the Super Series the winner of which will be the overall tour winner for the Sri Lanka and Pakistan series over all formats, said the former England captain.The rationale is that the game of cricket is evolving unbelievably quickly and I think we feel responsibility to ensure the international game develops. Central to that is context and relevance for every game of cricket you play. We believe the Super Series will provide that by connecting the formats and ensuring every game counts for something more than just itself.Two separate whiteball teams and a redball team will be connected by something greater than their own immediate interests. What this doesnt do is replace any of the individual series awards this summer so there will still be a Test series victory plus the one-day series and the Twenty20 match as well. But it sits on top of that wraps around it and creates something bigger to aim for.The ECB is very keen to be at the fore front of efforts to modernise the international game and we feel this is a good way of ensuring the game remains relevant in both fans and players minds.If the same points formula had been applied to Englands winter tours, the outcome would have been decided in the last match and the Test series winners would have been pipped at the line. Of course we would love the final game to be a Super Series decider that would be perfect, said Strauss.If you look at the last two series we played  against South Africa we would have lost the Super Series in the final Twenty20 and against Pakistan in the UAE we would have won the Super Series in the super over in the final Twenty20. Anyone out there who doesnt see the need for international cricket to keep moving forwards really does have their head stuck in the sand.I think we have to be on the front foot on this and say look we have a very vibrant Test support in this country and weve seen some fantastic Test matches over the last 12-18 months but there are some worrying signs there, so lets act before its too late.",5/20/2016,Sri Lanka Pakistan will face England under a new for,cricket,ISLAMABAD,Andrew Strauss;Andrew;Strauss,,EWCB;ECB;Wales Cricket Board

"Manchester United substitute Jesse Lingard's superb volley in extra time secured a 2-1 win over Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium on Saturday for their first major trophy in three years.However, their Dutch manager Louis van Gaal was left wondering whether it would be enough to preserve his job two seasons into a three-year contract amid British media reports that Jose Mourinho would be offered the job next week.The game was locked at 1-1 after 90 minutes, Jason Puncheon coming off the bench to put London side Palace ahead 12 minutes from time before Juan Mata equalised three minutes later.United central defender Chris Smalling was sent off in the extra period for a second yellow card but Lingard's moment of class gave them the Cup for the first time since 2004.""It's fantastic to win this title for the club, the fans and also for me,"" Van Gaal said. ""Now I have won a Cup in four countries. Not many managers can say that so I am very happy.""I don't want to talk about leaving the club.""<strong>BRILLIANT RUN</strongUnderdogs Palace took the lead when Puncheon, who had only come on six minutes earlier, deftly controlled a long ball into the area and fired past United goalkeeper David de Gea.But within three minutes Wayne Rooney went on a brilliant run across the edge of the Palace area and crossed for Marouane Fellaini to set up the equaliser for Spaniard Mata.Despite playing the second period of extra time with 10 men after Smalling's dismissal, United poured forward and Lingard's goal secured a 12th FA Cup triumph, equalling Arsenal's record.""I saw it come across and it landed nicely for me, all I had to do was hit it sweet and luckily I did that. As a sub you always have to be ready. Thankfully I was,"" Lingard said.Van Gaal, who arrived for his news conference carrying the trophy, added: ""It was a super goal when we needed it.""It was unbelievable that we had injuries again but in spite of going down to 10 players we showed the spirit we have shown on the road to the final.""Palace manager Alan Pardew, who played when the London club lost the replayed 1990 final against United, was frustrated by two refereeing decisions from Mark Clattenburg, who will be in charge of next weekend's Champions League final.He felt Wilfried Zaha should have had a penalty when tackled by Rooney and that play should have been waved on as Connor Wickham recovered from Smalling's challenge and scored.""It was a great cup final and could have gone either way,"" Pardew told reporters.<strong>UNITED DANGEROUS</strongPalace did not get quite enough from speedy winger Zaha, who United once bought for 15 million pounds ($21.76 million) before selling him back to their opponents, and Yannick Bolasie.The London side threatened mainly from set pieces, although the tall Fellaini was a valuable asset in defending them.United made the more dangerous chances throughout the game, hitting the post twice early in the second half through Fellaini and young French striker Anthony Martial.Rooney was an influential captain in his deeper midfield role and 18 year-old Marcus Rashford made several of their best opportunities, but had to go off injured in the 72nd minute.Van Gaal could not say how serious the injury was or whether it would prevent Rashford joining the England squad next week.It was the second time United had won the FA Cup after having a player sent off. Irish defender Kevin Moran was the first man dismissed in a final, when they beat Everton in 1985. Smalling was the fourth and the first Englishman.There was a bonus in Palace's defeat for West Ham United, who will join United in the Europa League next season after the east London side move into their new Olympic Stadium ground.",5/22/2016,Sublime Lingard volley seals Man United FA Cup wi,football,,Wilfried Zaha;de;Van;Jose Mourinho;Gaal;Mata;Jesse;Connor;Rooney;David de Gea.But;Wilfried;Louis van Gaal;Chris;Jason;Rashford;Jason Puncheon;van;Alan;Smalling;Zaha;Wayne;Kevin;Marcus;Gea.But;David;Lingard;Jesse Lingard;Louis;Anthony Martial.Rooney;Martial.Rooney;Mark Clattenburg;Kevin Moran;Puncheon;Mark;Chris Smalling;Wayne Rooney;Alan Pardew;Fellaini;Jose;Van Gaal;Clattenburg;Juan Mata;Marouane Fellaini;Anthony;Mourinho;Marouane;Wickham;Moran;Connor Wickham;Marcus Rashford;Pardew;Juan;Yannick,Lingard;Jesse Lingard,Palace;United;West Ham United;Crystal Palace;Arsenal;Manchester United;United in the Europa League;UNITED;Everton

"MELBOURNE: Australia captain Steven Smith has no qualms about playing another day-night test at Adelaide Oval but is wary of how the pink ball will perform in the humid conditions expected at Brisbane later this year.Australia plays Pakistan in the first test under lights at the Gabba on Dec. 15, despite warnings from former players and pundits that muggy conditions could make the ball unplayable for batsmen.In the inaugural day-night match against New Zealand in drier Adelaide conditions last year, the ball hooped around menacingly during the floodlit late sessions and Australia won in three days.Cricket Australia (CA) hope to schedule another test against South Africa at Adelaide Oval in November but the Proteas have balked at the prospect, citing a lack of experience with the pink ball.""I think it worked well, the one test at the Adelaide Oval,"" Smith told reporters in Brisbane on Monday.""I personally believe that's the best place to play a day-night test match but we've got the one at the Gabba this year so it will be interesting to see how that goes.strong>GRASSY SURFACE</strong""It's just a little bit different with the ball and humidity that quite often is around in Brisbane, so it could be very difficult for the batters, particularly if there's grass left on the wicket.""Fears that the pink ball might not last the required 80 overs in test cricket saw a grassy pitch prepared for the Adelaide match, making the task much harder for batsmen.""I think we still need plenty of development with the ball to make sure that we don't prepare a wicket that suits the ball with plenty of grass on it,"" Smith added.South Africa captain AB de Villiers said last month that his team had misgivings about playing the day-night test after getting feedback from Smith and some other Australian players.Although Smith responded by backing Cricket Australia's campaign for the Adelaide match, he was less enthused about playing a personal role in talking South Africa around.""I guess we could have conversations about it with some of the senior players in South Africa but in the end it's up to both boards what they want to do in regards to the game,"" he said.Smith will lead the one-day team in a triangular tournament in the Caribbean against West Indies and South Africa next month and said he had recovered from a wrist injury that ended his stint in the Indian Premier League (IPL) prematurely.",5/23/2016,Australia captain Smith wary pink ball test Gabb,cricket,MELBOURNE,AB;de;Villiers;Smith;AB de Villiers;Steven Smith;Steven,Smith;Gabb;Steven Smith,Indian Premier League

"Manchester United sacked manager Louis van Gaal on Monday after an FA Cup triumph failed to make up for the club's inability to qualify for the Champions League amid widespread discontent with a season of insipid performances.The Dutchman was dismissed two days after United's win over Crystal Palace in the Wembley Cup final, their first trophy in three years, paving the way for the widely-expected appointment of former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho as his successor.News of Van Gaal's impending departure from the club leaked out minutes after Saturday's 2-1 extra-time victory over Palace and, following relentless media speculation and a day of negotiations, it was confirmed by both sides on Monday evening.""I'd like to thank Louis and his staff for their excellent work in the past two years culminating in winning a record-equalling 12th FA Cup for the club,"" executive vice chairman Ed Woodward said in a statement on the website of the club owned by the American Glazer family (www.manutd.com).""He has behaved with great professionalism and dignity throughout his time here. He leaves us with a legacy of having given several young players the confidence to show their ability on the highest stage.""Van Gaal, though gushing in his appreciation of the chance to manage the club, was not so happy to be moving on.""I am very disappointed to be unable to complete our intended three-year plan,"" he said.""It has been an honour to manage such a magnificent club as Manchester United FC, and in doing so, I have fulfilled a long-held ambition.""I have been privileged during my management career to have won 20 trophies but winning the FA Cup, which is steeped in so much history, will always be one of the most special achievements of my career.""That success, however, could not gloss over a season in which United finished fifth in the standings, missing out on Champions League qualification, and where dull performances had the fans booing their own team even after victories.<strong>DISGRUNTLED FANS</strongAfter replacing David Moyes two years ago, Van Gaal got the team into the Champions League in his first season.However, United's inability to produce the free-flowing football that characterised Alex Ferguson's trophy-laden reign eventually caused a rift throughout the club and in the stands.For generations of fans brought up to expect high octane attacking football, Van Gaal's stultifying approach was hard to swallow, particularly when it did not work well, after he spent almost 300 million pounds ($434.34 million) on players.This season's dire statistics, beyond the key one of fifth place, are a damning indictment of the Dutchman's tactics.United scored 49 goals in 38 games, in contrast to their previous Premier League average of over 76 and fourth-placed Manchester City's 71.They had the joint-highest number of goalless draws in the division, while Opta noted that United's 430 shots on target was 15th in the 20-team league and they made more backward passes than any other side.It was not just supporters who were disgruntled either.A story in Monday's Guardian newspaper said squad members had talked among themselves about openly defying the Dutchman's rigid tactical directions, which allegedly included instructions to players not to take first-time shots.It also reported that the two most senior players, Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick, had raised concerns with Van Gaal about his post-match ""evaluation sessions"" in which he publicly criticised players in front of their team mates<strong>WIDESPREAD DISSATISFACTION</strongWith such widespread dissatisfaction it easy to forget that the 64-year-old former Ajax Amsterdam, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Netherlands coach was seen as the safe option when he was hired by United in May 2014 following Moyes's sacking.He got the club back in the Champions League with a fourth-place finish but, despite heavy spending on the likes of Memphis Depay, Anthony Martial and Bastian Schweinsteiger, United stagnated after topping the table at the end of September.French striker Martial apart, the new players struggled to justify their fees, and Van Gaal increasingly turned to talented youngsters such as Marcus Rashford, who has rapidly emerged from United's youth team to earn a place in the England squad.By mid-December United were out of the top four after successive defeats by promoted clubs Bournemouth and Norwich City and they exited the Champions League after finishing third in a modest group behind VfL Wolfsburg and PSV Eindhoven.At home to Southampton United were booed off the pitch and in Denmark the supporters, already frustrated by finding their team playing in the Europa League, chanted obscenities about how bad Van Gaal's side were in a 2-1 loss to FC Midjytlland.Despite recovering with a 5-1 win in the second leg, United then lost to Liverpool in the round of 16.A late challenge for fourth place, the Cup run and the fan-pleasing introduction of the youngsters, bought Van Gaal time but in the bigger picture it was not enough to change the mood.Hovering in the background since his sacking in December has been Mourinho, once the scourge of Old Trafford for Porto and Chelsea but now seemingly about to be welcomed with open arms.The Portuguese is hardly a graduate of the swashbuckling school of football himself but his remarkable record of success across Europe, combined with a larger-than-life personality, mean that, if he is appointed, United fans will at least be able to look forward to next season rather than dreading it.",5/24/2016,Van Gaal sacked by United Mourinho poised to step

"Cristiano Ronaldo owes most of his fame and fortune to his exploits with Real Madrid, yet he also remains a hugely influential figure when representing his country.Portugal's results have improved enormously since Ronaldo made his international debut against Kazakhstan as an 18-year-old in 2003.Their recent record at major tournaments is the envy of many bigger countries after they reached the Euro 2004 final, 2006 World Cup semi-finals and the Euro 2012 semi-finals, where they lost to eventual winners Spain in a shootout.Portugal have suffered when Ronaldo, who has captained them since he was 22, has been off-form such as at the last World Cup when he suffered a bout of tendinosis in his left knee in the run-up to the competition.The Madeira-born forward, who makes a point of breaking records, is Portugal's all-time leading scorer with 56 goals in 125 appearances and needs three more caps to beat Luis Figo's record.Nevertheless, the three-time world player of the year has not been above criticism, with most of his goals coming in qualifying matches against weaker opponents and many supporters wondering why he did not take a penalty in the 2012 shootout against Spain.It is, though, hard to imagine Portugal without him and Ronaldo himself says he wants to play for his country until at least the 2018 World Cup and maybe beyond.""I don't make plans in my sporting life,"" he said in February.

"English football's biggest club seem to have secured the services of the sport's most colourful manager after Jose Mourinho, according to Sky TV reports, agreed personal terms with Manchester United on Tuesday.After a trophy-laden career with Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid, Mourinho is set to replace Dutchman Louis van Gaal, who was sacked on Monday, with a remit to bring back the glory days the club once took for granted under Alex Ferguson.The 53-year-old, sacked by Chelsea in December seven months after winning his third Premier League title at the London club over two spells, had been constantly linked with the United job as Van Gaal struggled to make an impression at Old Trafford.The Dutchman was dismissed two days after steering United to their first FA Cup success in 12 years when they beat Crystal Palace 2-1 after extra-time in Saturday's Wembley final.Van Gaal's preferred possession-dominated playing style at a club more readily associated with fast, direct attacking, was widely criticised, and it appeared to take his players time to adapt.Mourinho is also known for pragmatism, however, relying on a strong defensive foundation and hard-working midfielders and strikers.He has a history of success wherever he has managed and a proven track record in the English game.Mourinho won the UEFA Cup and Champions League as well as the domestic double twice in his two seasons at Porto and led Chelsea to their first top-flight title in 50 years in his first campaign, retaining it the following season.He also won the League Cup and FA Cup before moving to Inter where he won Serie A as well as the Champions League and Italian Cup.Mourinho helped Real to their first La Liga crown in four years and on returning to Chelsea, he again won the Premier League before an unexpectedly poor -- and troubled -- start to the 2015-16 season led to his sacking.<strong>DIVIDED OPINION</strongHis imminent appointment at Old Trafford, touted in the media for months, will divide opinion but while some have voiced concern over playing style and potentially explosive personality clashes, he is widely considered to be as close to a guarantee of silverware as a manager can be.The challenge will be not only to deliver success but to do it in style.Van Gaal's FA Cup triumph was not enough to allow him to see out the final year of his contract on the back of a season in which the club's fans routinely voiced their frustration with the safety-first football being served up.Mourinho is not known for throwing caution to the wind but fans will hope that under his leadership United will at least not again be ranked top in the Premier League for the number of backwards passes made as they were under Van Gaal.There will also be pressure for the new man to continue the good work of his predecessor in bringing young players such as Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard to the fore, something else Mourinho has singularly failed to do at most of his previous clubs.However, after three seasons without a league title and with no Champions League football for a second time in three years, the United hierarchy are evidently prepared to accept potential downsides if the 'Special One' gets the club back to what they consider to be their rightful place at the sport's top table.Former Old Trafford goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel believes the Portuguese ""could save"" the club while Hull City manager Steve Bruce, who used to play in front of the Dane in central defence, said the chance to bring in Mourinho was ""too good to miss"".Former Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti, who will coach Bayern Munich next season, said Mourinho would be a ""fantastic signing"", adding United had ""lost its identity this last year"".Former Old Trafford great Eric Cantona, however, said his old team should have gone for incoming Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola instead, saying he ""loved"" Mourinho but that his style of play is ""not Manchester United"".Retired Dutch international Ronald de Boer believes Mourinho is ""similar"" to Van Gaal in being a ""workaholic"" who ""prepares perfectly on how to win"".De Boer, who worked with Van Gaal at Ajax Amsterdam and with both men at Barcelona, said of Mourinho: ""Sometimes it is not pretty but he knows how to grind out wins.

"Brazilian investigators have expanded their probe into possible corruption around the staging of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro this August to include all the venues and services financed with federal funds, a lead prosecutor told Reuters.Federal investigations have previously focused on ""legacy"" modernization projects not directly tied to the Games but this newly disclosed probe includes Olympic Park and the Deodoro area where Olympic venues are located, federal prosecutor Leandro Mitidieri said.""It's not just the physical works we're looking at - it is contracts for services, security, everything that used federal funds,"" he told Reuters from his Rio de Janeiro office late on Tuesday.The Olympics were meant to showcase Brazil's rise as a global power. Instead, they will take place as suspended President Dilma Rousseff faces an impeachment trial, the economy suffers its worst recession since the 1930s, an outbreak of the Zika virus prompts health concerns and a massive corruption scandal infuriates Brazilians.Mitidieri said his team is also investigating what happened to federal funds earmarked for cleaning Guanabara Bay, where Olympic sailing events will take place, and lakes that surround the main Olympic venues in western Rio's Barra neighborhood.Those bodies of water have heavy sewage contamination and remain badly polluted despite promises to drastically improve them as a legacy achievement of the Olympics.Another team of federal prosecutors, along with federal police, is investigating whether the Rio de Janeiro state water utility company Cedae committed environmental crimes by not properly treating sewage in Rio's metropolitan area of 12 million people, Mitidieri said.Rio utility Cedae said it had not been notified about the investigation and could not make a comment without understanding more about the probe.Mitidieri would not say if his team had uncovered any proof of corruption - but he added that detailed announcements about the investigation's results would be made in coming weeks.Five construction firms are building most of the 39 billion reais ($10.8 billion) worth of venues and infrastructure needed for Rio's Olympics. The figure includes at least 1.76 billion reais in federal funds, according to documents from Brazil's federal accounting court.All five companies are caught up in an investigation into price fixing and kickbacks at state-run oil company Petrobras, a two-year probe that has seen scores of top executives and politicians jailed, charged or under investigation.The Petrobras (PETR4.SA) investigation is what led federal police and prosecutors to begin looking at possible corruption tied to the Olympics.Federal authorities have already said they are investigating the Porto Maravilha project, an 8 billion real facelift of Rio's dilapidated port area, and also the expansion of the city's metro line to the Olympic area in Barra.Court files made public in March showed police uncovered documents from executives of Latin America's largest construction firm, Odebrecht SA [ODBES.UL], that referenced 1 million reais in suspected bribes connected to those two big legacy projects.Odebrecht is at the center of the Petrobras scandal and is involved in over half of all Olympic projects by value, according to contracts reviewed by Reuters.A spokeswoman for Odebrecht said by email that the company had no comment to make.Mitidieri declined to provide details on which companies are the focus of the federal probe, though he did note that OAS SA [OAS.UL] and Queiroz Galvao had ""a lot of activity"" in the Deodoro region of the Olympics. OAS did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Queiroz Galvao wrote in an email that the company had not been notified about the investigation and had no further comment.Rio de Janeiro's city government oversees most Olympic construction projects, though a few are financed by the federal or state government. The city government says contracts were mostly funded with private resources and that all bids were overseen by regulators.Rio 2016, the local organizing committee, handles some non-permanent structures like seating, and has a budget of 7 billion reais.The federal government, Mitidieri noted, is by law responsible for any debts the local organizing committee may incur.The Rio 2016 local organizing committee referred questions to the mayor's office.The mayor's office said it would not comment without knowing what exact contracts were under investigation. It added in its emailed response that all contracts were carried out in a transparent manner and that city officials were prepared to provide any clarifications necessary.",5/26/2016,Exclusive Brazil investigating possible corruption at Olympic venu,sailing,,Galvao;Mitidieri;Leandro;Queiroz Galvao;Rousseff;Leandro Mitidieri;Dilma Rousseff;Dilma;Queiroz;Cedae;Rio;Brazilians.Mitidieri,,OAS;Petrobras;Porto Maravilha;Odebrecht;OAS SA;Reuters.A;Odebrecht SA;Reuters

"BARCELONA: Cristiano Ronaldo says he will be ""100 percent"" in Saturday's Champions League final as he attempts to fire Real Madrid to a record-extending 11th European Cup and further torment their city rivals, Atletico.The prolific Portuguese set alarm bells ringing on Tuesday when he ended training prematurely with a knock but was fit to train again the following day.Although Ronaldo scored the final goal in Real's 4-1 extra-time win over Atletico in the 2014 final in Lisbon, he has admitted he was far from at his best due to a hamstring problem and is determined to put in a better performance at Milan's San Siro on Saturday.""Cristiano always appears in the games that matter. I'll be at 100 per cent. On Saturday, I'll be in better form than I was in Lisbon,"" Ronaldo told Spanish television channel La Sexta.""In Lisbon, my hamstring was hurting me. It was pretty bad. It was terrible because you know that in certain moments you could give more but you can't because your body doesn't respond.""Ronaldo has scored -- and been on the winning side -- in both the Champions League finals he has played in, having also won in 2008 with Manchester United.He is top scorer in this season's tournament with 16 goals and is one strike away from equalling the record tally of 17 he set in 2013/14.Real's all-time top scorer also gave the club a lift before the final by declaring he wants to stay at Real for the long term.""Real Madrid would be making a smart decision if they offered me a new contract,"" he added.Zinedine Zidane's men are without defenders Raphael Varane and Alvaro Arbeloa for the game, while Atletico have a clean bill of health.It's a far cry from the dishevelled state in which Diego Simeone's team arrived at the 2014 final, when they struggled with fitness after a long season and suffered key injuries.On their way to that Madrid showdown Atletico won 1-0 at the San Siro. Real, on the other hand, have never won a competitive game at the stadium in 13 attempts.Defender Diego Godin says Atletico are in better shape than last time around, and thinks his side's team ethic, instilled into them by the charismatic Simeone, could prove key to winning their first European Cup.Godin told Uefa.com: Our big secret is the effort the team puts in.

Englands bowlers could not have had a better platform to launch their attack than Moeens 207-ball innings, which was his best in tests and his second century against Sri Lanka.At times watchful and then belligerent, Moeen became only the fifth England number seven to reach three figures in tests after being promoted one place in the order to cover for the injured Ben Stokes.The Worcestershire all-rounder moved on from his overnight 28 and made the most of the three lives the tourists gave him on Saturday.Support came from Woakes, who shared a stand of 92, and Steven Finn, who scored just 10 of their ninth-wicket stand of 72.

For Sri Lanka to get anywhere near such an imposing total was a huge ask and James Anderson, who had taken 10 wickets in the first test, quickly removed opener Dimuth Karunaratne with a ripper that bowled him round his legs.Broad followed up by having Kaushal Silva taken behind by Bairstow and the keeper took further catches to remove Dinesh Chandimal off Anderson and Angelo Mathews and Siriwadana off Woakes.Broad broke Heraths late resistance via another sharp Anderson catch and removed Shaminda Eranga as England, who won the first test in the three-test series by an innings and 88 runs, stayed on course for another crushing win.Lahiru Thirimanne (11) and Suranga Lakmal (0) were not out at the close.",5/28/2016,England sense victory as Woakes and Broad stri,cricket,,Jonny Bairstow;Mathews;Finn;Shaminda;Kusal;James Anderson;Dimuth;Chandimal;Angelo;Cook;Siriwadana;Dimuth Karunaratne;Kusal Mendis;Rangana;Angelo Mathews;Kaushal Silva;Milinda Siriwadana;Lakmal;Suranga Lakmal;Milinda;Kaushal;Herath;Bairstow;Silva;James;Eranga;Ben;Rangana Herath;Anderson;Moeen Ali;Steven Finn;Steven;Karunaratne;Jonny;Dinesh Chandimal;Dinesh;Suranga;Shaminda Eranga;Moeen;Heraths;Ali;Mendis,,Worcestershire;Alastair Cooks;Warwickshire
"Argentina had a scare when Lionel Messi had to be substituted after incurring a back injury during a 1-0 win over rugged Honduras in a Copa America Centenario warm-up friendly on Friday.Messi walked off in pain in the 64th minute in San Juan after a clash with Honduras substitute Oliver Morazan 10 days before Argentina's opening Group D match against Chile.The team later dispelled fears of a serious injury, saying on their Twitter account that Messi had suffered bruising on the left of his lower back and ribs.Gonzalo Higuain scored the only goal for Argentina.In other warm-up matches for the June 3-26 tournament in the United States, Edinson Cavani struck twice as Uruguay overcame Trinidad and Tobago 3-1 and title holders Chile were upset 2-1 by Jamaica.Higuain struck after half an hour for Argentina when he received a low cross from the left by Marcos Rojo with his back to goal, turned central defender Maynor Figueroa and chipped left-footed over goalkeeper Donis Escober.Argentina meet Chile in Santa Clara, California, on June 6 and also face Bolivia and Panama in Group D.Uruguay, without the injured Luis Suarez, came from a goal down after Jomal Williams had put the Trinidadians ahead in the seventh minute in Montevideo.Cavani equalized with a 26th-minute penalty for a foul by Weslie John on midfielder Nicolas Lodeiro and put Uruguay ahead in the 39th with a shot from the right at a corner.Matias Vecino, who made his debut against Brazil in a World Cup qualifier in March, increased Uruguays lead seven minutes after halftime with his first international goal.Uruguay face Mexico in Glendale, Arizona on June 5 before also meeting Jamaica and Venezuela in Group C.Jamaica, who meet Venezuela in Chicago on June 5, stunned a Chile side fielding several reserves in Vina del Mar scoring through Clayton Donaldson and Simon Dawkins before substitute Nicolas Castillo pulled one back late on.",5/28/2016,Messi worries Argentina back injury,football,Argentina,Edinson;Rojo;Cavani;Morazan;John;del;Nicolas;Lionel;Williams;Jomal;Weslie John;Simon;Higuain;Maynor;Donaldson;Weslie;Simon Dawkins;Lionel Messi;Maynor Figueroa;Luis Suarez;Oliver;Suarez;Vina del Mar;Nicolas Castillo;Vina;Clayton;Dawkins;Nicolas Lodeiro;Figueroa;Lodeiro;Luis;Marcos;Castillo;Edinson Cavani;Oliver Morazan;Messi;Clayton Donaldson;Jomal Williams;Marcos Rojo;Donis;Mar,Messi;Lionel Messi,Copa America Centenario
"Marcus Rashford's rapid progress continued as the 18-year-old took 138 seconds to become the youngest player to score on his England debut in a 2-1 friendly win over Australia on Friday.The Manchester United striker probably booked his place in Roy Hodgson's Euro 2016 squad and his Manchester United team mate Wayne Rooney added a second before substitute Eric Dier headed a late own goal.But the night belonged to Rashford, who netted three minutes into what was only his 19th professional match, stroking the ball first time past goalkeeper Matt Ryan after creating space inside the area at Sunderland's Stadium of Light.Rashford, who also scored on his United debut in February, could have had a second goal minutes later and produced an assured performance before coming off on the hour.Manager Hodgson praised his debutant but refused to confirm whether Rashford will be in the trimmed down 23-man squad that must be named before Tuesday.""It was fantastic, he did very well and I am pleased for him on his debut,"" Hodgson said. ""He would not be out of place in anyone's 23.""Rashford probably only started against Australia because of an injury to Daniel Sturridge, but Hodgson said he was hopeful the Liverpool striker will recover sufficiently to train with the squad on Monday.""If he does, the calf injury will not be a reason to leave him out of the 23,"" said Hodgson.

"BENGALURU: The final of the Indian Premier League was indeed a nail-biting contest as Virat Kohli's Challengers fell short of chasing the 209-run target set by Warner's Sunrisers.While Gayle and Virat Kohli did add fire to the run-chase earlier on with his 54-run knock as Gayle also chipped in with 76 runs, it fell short of the Sunriser's daunting total of 209. After Virat Kohli was dismissed and Gayle too, no other Challengers' batsman was able to stand tall as even the mighty Shane Watson fell cheaply for 18 runs.Hence, the Royal Challengers Bangalore could not successfully chase the whole target and had to concede the title to the Sunrisers.

"Martina Hingis and Sania Mirza lost their cool as their hopes of holding all four grand slam titles were dashed following a 6-3 6-2 defeat by Czech duo Barbora Krejcikova and Katerina Siniakova in the third round of the French Open on Sunday.The Indo-Swiss team dubbed ""Santina"" were hoping to win four majors in a row after following up last year's Wimbledon and U.S. Open triumphs with victory in January's Australian Open.But the top seeds appeared all at sea on a gloomy day at Roland Garros and their bid to complete the 'Santina Slam' ended after the Czechs blasted a service return winner to break Hingis in the final game.Hingis and Mirza were left fuming at the umpire after a call went against them as they trailed 4-1 in the second set. Mirza tossed the ball in anger but the duo failed to win the argument, or the match, leaving Krejcikova and Siniakova to celebrate a memorable victory.It proved to be a bad day for the big names in doubles as Venus and Serena Williams, who were the last women's team to hold all four majors in 2010, also perished in the third round, beaten 6-3 6-3 by the Dutch-Swedish pairing of Kiki Bertens and Johanna Larsson.",5/29/2016,Hingis and Mirza lose chance to complete Santina S,tennis,,Santina;Katerina Siniakova;Kiki Bertens;Williams;Bertens;Sania Mirza;Barbora Krejcikova;Hingis;Johanna;Larsson;Martina;Serena Williams;Sania;Martina Hingis;Siniakova;Mirza;Krejcikova;Venus;Barbora;Katerina;Johanna Larsson;Serena;Kiki,Mirza;Santina;Hingis;Sania Mirza;Martina Hingis,Roland Garros
"With Rafael Nadal out of the picture this year, Garbine Muguruza, who beat Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-3 6-4 to reach the last eight at Roland Garros on Sunday, is probably the best chance of a Spanish triumph at the French Open.The fourth seed moved into the quarter-finals for the third year in a row with a solid display as she looks to become the first Spanish woman to lift the Suzanne Lenglen Cup since Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in 1998.Hard hitter Muguruza, who has yet to make it to the last four in Paris, left little breathing space for the Russian 13th seed, the 2009 Roland Garros champion, in a style different to that of Sanchez Vicario, a pure claycourt specialist.""I know maybe now I'm more a favourite, but I could have lost two days ago,"" Muguruza told reporters.The Wimbledon runner-up believes she is now better equipped to go a step further.""I think the one thing that I have really improved is not just one type of shot. It's me, generally speaking. It's me -- it's the way I prepare matches,"" she said.""I think I have more experience. When I win I analyse why. When I lose I analyse why. And therefore, I have become a better player, generally speaking.""It's not that I have improved my forehand or anything specific.""Muguruza peppered the court with winners -- which made up for numerous unforced errors -- and broke decisively on her seventh opportunity to lead 5-3 in the opening set.She closed it out with a booming forehand winner and broke again in the third game of the second set with a service return winner.Kuznetsova saw a lifeline when she broke back to 4-4 as Muguruza started to get inconsistent, only for the Spaniard to break again in the following game with a fine passing shot.Muguruza, however, showed signs of nerves and wasted two match points before serving a double fault. She regained her composure, though, and wrapped it up on her fifth match point when Kuznetsova's backhand sailed long.The Spaniard will next face either American Shelby Rogers or Romanian 25th seed Irina Camelia Begu.",5/29/2016,Aggressive Muguruza downs Kuznetsova to reach Paris last eig,tennis,,Garbine Muguruza;Rafael;Rogers;Irina;Arantxa Sanchez Vicario;Kuznetsova;Begu;Roland Garros;Irina Camelia Begu;Svetlana;Arantxa;Camelia;Vicario;Garbine;Nadal;Svetlana Kuznetsova;Rafael Nadal;Garros;Roland;Sanchez Vicario;Shelby Rogers;Shelby;Muguruza;Sanchez,Kuznetsova;Svetlana Kuznetsova,Roland Garros

"DURHAM: Alastair Cook became the first Englishman to reach 10,000 test runs before leading his team to an emphatic nine-wicket win over Sri Lanka in the second test on Monday to wrap up the series.Cook scored 47 not out as England eased to their target of 79 after Dinesh Chandimal made a fine century to lift Sri Lanka to 475 in their second innings on the fourth day.Having been bowled out for 101 first time round, however, the tourists only delayed the inevitable and England took an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series with a day to spare.""Its a very special moment for me, but the game is not about personal milestones, its about winning games and scoring runs to do that,"" Cook said.""But its a real special day and its great that my family are here to see me do it.

"MELBOURNE: Australia's search for a successor to Shane Warne is yet to bear fruit nearly a decade after he retired, so Adam Zampa is naturally wary about comparisons with the leg-spinning great.The 24-year-old has been picked in Australia's squad for the triangular one-day international tournament in the Caribbean and will battle off-spinner Nathan Lyon and slow-bowling all-rounder Glenn Maxwell for a place against West Indies and South Africa.Unheralded only a few months ago, Zampa first made his mark in the most unusual of circumstances when he 'ran out' a batsman with his nose when playing for Melbourne Stars in Australia's 'Big Bash' league.A good performance in the that tournament led to a spot in Australia's World Twenty20 squad and after making his ODI debut against New Zealand in February, Zampa impressed in the Indian Premier League (IPL) at new franchise Rising Pune Supergiants.His bowling action and run-up have been compared to Warne's, which has further fuelled the hype, but the New South Welshman says that is where the similarities end.""There's only ever going to be one Shane Warne,"" Zampa told Australian media.""The attributes he had, how strong he was, his leg-spinner was unbelievable and to be able to bowl that leg-spinner for as long as he did for five days for his whole career was something unbelievable.""People do look at me and think I look a lot like him but I think the only thing that would be similar is the smoother run-up. It's a nice comparison but I don't really think about it that way.""strong>FAILED EXPERIMENTS</strongSince Warne's retirement after the final Ashes test against England in 2007, Australian selectors have barely flirted with leg-spin.Victorian Bryce McGain lasted one test in 2009, promptly discarded after going wicketless for 149 runs against South Africa in Cape Town.Early in his career, incumbent captain Steve Smith was picked as a leg-spinning all-rounder against England in the 2010-11 series but later shelved his bowling to concentrate on becoming an elite batsman.Left-arm wrist-spinner Beau Casson briefly stepped into the spotlight when he was selected for a match against West Indies on the 2008 tour but duly fell into a form rut and was never looked at again.Lyon has since cemented himself as Australia's premier slow bowler and Zampa missed out on a place in the test squad to tour Sri Lanka in July and August.Zampa, however, hopes to impress ahead of next year's tour of India, where he has shown his comfort with South Asian pitches.""The white ball at the moment is probably something I'm concentrating on but if I keep improving, I feel like it doesn't matter what format you're playing,"" he said.Australia play the first ODI against West Indies in Providence, Guyana on June 5.",5/30/2016,Dont call Warney Australia prospect Z,cricket,MELBOURNE,Shane;Bryce McGain;Glenn Maxwell;Warne;Beau;Maxwell;Nathan;Zampa;Beau Casson;Steve Smith;Glenn;Casson;Smith;Lyon;McGain;Nathan Lyon;Adam;Shane Warne;Adam Zampa;Steve;Bryce,,Melbourne Stars;IPL;West Indies;Indian Premier League

"Sweden missed the influence of captain Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who was resting a sore calf muscle, as they struggled to create chances in a dull 0-0 draw with Slovenia in their penultimate Euro 2016 warm-up in Malmo on Monday.With their record scorer on the bench and many other players yet to join the squad, Sweden coach Erik Hamren fielded an experimental lineup bearing little resemblance to the one that will kick off their campaign against Ireland on June 13.Hamren gave Celta Vigo striker John Guidetti a chance to stake a claim for a starting spot alongside Ibrahimovic and the 24-year-old put in an energetic performance, almost breaking the deadlock with a curling second-half shot that flew just over.Sebastian Larsson also took a free kick from a dangerous position for the Swedes, but he too could not keep the ball down and it flew harmlessly over the bar.With midfielder Kim Kallstrom resting a tight groin and Albin Ekdal still recovering from a back injury, Sweden lacked a player with the passing ability to unlock Slovenia's defence.The visitors threatened several times on the break but goalkeeper Andreas Isaksson, having been made captain in Ibrahimovic's absence, was in no mood to spoil the occasion by conceding a goal.With lots of empty seats at the Swedbank Stadium, the biggest cheers on the night were reserved for hometown favourite Ibrahimovic, whose every appearance on the big screens was met with rapturous applause.Sweden take on fellow Euro 2016 finalists Wales in their final pre-tournament friendly in Stockholm on Sunday before heading to France, where they will face Italy and Belgium as well as Ireland in Group E.",5/31/2016,Sweden miss rested Ibrahimovic in 0 0 draw with Sloveni,football,Sweden,Hamren;Zlatan;Guidetti;Celta;John;Kim Kallstrom;Kallstrom;Erik Hamren;Erik;Zlatan Ibrahimovic;Vigo;John Guidetti;Albin;Celta Vigo;Larsson;Albin Ekdal;Ibrahimovic;Kim;Andreas Isaksson;Isaksson;Ekdal;Andreas,Sloveni;Ibrahimovic;Zlatan Ibrahimovic,

Tuesday's hearing showed that Spain's tax office made 20 inspections of Messi during its two-year investigation.According to the prosecutors' office, revenue was hidden using shell companies in Uruguay, Belize, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.Messi and his father paid five million euros to the tax authorities as a ""corrective"" measure after being formally investigated in June 2013.In addition to Messi, Spain's tax office has also begun investigating the finances of high-profile Barcelona players such as Neymar Jr, Javier Mascherano and Adriano.A resident in Barcelona since 2000, Messi became a Spanish citizen in 2005.

"Soccer's five-times World Player of the Year Lionel Messi arrived at a court in Barcelona on Thursday to testify against charges of tax evasion.A few bypassers applauded the arrival of the Argentina and FC Barcelona player while several people shouted at him, but in contrast to when he appeared at a local court in 2013 to give evidence, there were no Barcelona supporters present.Messi and his father, Jorge Horacio Messi, entered the court immediately without speaking to reporters.The trial began on Tuesday although Messi missed the first and second day, which he was not obliged to attend, citing a back injury sustained in Argentina's international friendly with Honduras last Friday.Lionel and Jorge Horacio Messi are accused by the Spanish tax office of defrauding the government of 4.2 million euros ($4.7 million) between 2007 and 2009.They could face jail terms of up to 22 months if found guilty, although it is customary in Spain that offenders of non-violent crime with a sentence of under two years do not serve time in jail.The case centres on the player's image rights and a web of shell companies allegedly used to evade taxes on income from those rights.Tuesday's hearing showed that Spain's tax office made 20 inspections of Messi during its three-year investigation.According to the prosecutors' office, revenue was hidden using shell companies in Uruguay, Belize, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.Messi and his father paid five million euros to the tax authorities as a ""corrective"" measure after being formally investigated in June 2013.Spain's tax office has also begun investigating the finances of Messi's Barcelona team-mates Neymar Jr, Javier Mascherano and Adriano.Mascherano accepted a one-year prison sentence for tax evasion as part of a plea bargain in January, although is not expected to serve time in jail.Messi moved to Barcelona from his birth place of Rosario, Argentina in 2000, becoming a Spanish citizen in 2005.He is 10th on Forbes Magazine's list of the world's highest-earning athletes over the past decade, with an estimated income of $350 million.Messi has scored 453 goals in 531 appearances for Barca in all competitions.He has also won eight La Liga titles, four King's Cups and four Champions League crowns with Barca, leading them to a league and cup double last season.Messi is also captain of Argentina and will rejoin the team immediately after his court appearance to prepare for the Copa America in the USA, playing their first game against holders Chile on Jun. 7.

"DHAKA: Mustafizur Rahmans participation in the English Twenty20 tournament for Sussex was thrown into doubt Thursday after Bangladesh cricket officials said they feared the paceman may be suffering from burnout.The 20-year-old bowling sensation, nicknamed Fizz, returned home this week to a heros welcome after helping Sunrisers Hyderabad win their maiden Indian Premier League title with 17 wickets from 16 matches.Rahman was named emerging player of the tournament, the first foreign cricketer to be bestowed with the honour, after conceding just 6.9 runs per over, the most miserly among those who bowled in at least 10 matches.He is scheduled to join English county side Sussex next week after signing as their second overseas cricketer in March for the NatWest T20 Blast and the Royal London One-Day Cup.But his participation appeared to hit a stumbling block after the Bangladesh Cricket Board said they would first assess his health before allowing him to join the English side.""We will assess his condition next week before making a final decision on whether hell be allowed to play in England,"" BCB chief executive officer Nizamuddin Chowdhury told AFP.Bangladesh national team physio Baizidul Islam said Rahman did not aggravate any of his injuries in the IPL, but that the board were worried over his recent workload.""We must consider that he played 19 matches in two months after recovering from injuries,"" Islam said.""So there must be some fatigue. He also developed some problems in his right ankle which is creating a problem for his landing after completing a delivery,"" he said.""He needs some rest to remove the stress. If he continues like this he may collapse any time.

"Novak Djokovic had 100 million reasons to celebrate reaching the French Open quarter-finals on Wednesday -- albeit two days later than expected -- as players finally cleared the fourth-round backlog created by the fickle Parisian weather.After relentless rain washed out all but two hours of play over the previous two days, under-fire Roland Garros organisers said such conditions had not been seen since 1873 as they frantically tried to play catch-up by staging 12 singles matches -- instead of just four quarter-finals as is the norm -- on day 11 of the sodden championships.That allowed world number one Djokovic to become the first tennis player to bank $100 million in prize money after his 3-6 6-4 6-1 7-5 win over Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut tipped him over the magic number.Having won a match that was originally scheduled for Monday, begun on Tuesday and completed on Wednesday, the 29-year-old Serb will have to play four days in succession if he is to reach Sunday's title showdown.""I have the feeling I played three matches against him,"" a grinning Djokovic told the crowd after donning a yellow rain hat during his victory speech.""Yesterday the match was interrupted three times and it wasn't easy coming here at 9 am and leaving at 7.30 or 8:00 pm.""So that's the reason why we should have the roof here,"" added the Serb, who joined the likes of golfer Tiger Woods and boxer Lennox Lewis in the $100 million club.However, rather than getting worked up about the French Open not having any court cover like the other three majors, it was the organisers' decision to make the players compete in misty rain on Tuesday that overshadowed Wednesday's on-court action.Serena Williams, who like Djokovic was bogged down in the fourth round for more than 48 hours, booked her place in the quarter-finals by walloping Ukrainian 18th seed Elina Svitolina 6-1 6-1. She will next face Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva.In the bottom half of the men's draw, Andy Murray doused some early fireworks from Frenchman Richard Gasquet to win 5-7 7-6(3) 6-0 6-2 to set up a blockbuster semi-final against holder Stan Wawrinka. The Swiss beat Albert Ramos (Spain) 6-2 6-1 7-6(7).<strong>RAIN PLAY STILL A HOT TOPIC</strongBut the hot topic of the day remained what the organisers did, or did not do, on Tuesday.Djokovic's victim Bautista Agut said officials had ""pushed us to play two hours yesterday"" -- the threshold needed to avoid reimbursing money to ticket-holders -- while Venus Williams labelled the conditions ""really bad"" after being ambushed 6-2 6-4 by Switzerland's Timea Bacsinszky.""The conditions were not playable yesterday. It's hard to see. The balls are wet, the courts are wet,"" said the American, whose defeat ended hopes of an all-Williams semi-final.French Open director Guy Forget defended the tournament's actions.""I understand that not refunding spectators .... has caused frustration and anger,"" he said.""If what we are being accused of were true, it would have been in our best interests to stop play before the one-hour, 59-minute mark as our insurer would have been responsible for ticket reimbursement.""However... our aim was to play for as long as possible, even if that meant being criticised for playing in difficult conditions.""Djokovic will be hoping he does not face another soggy day on Thursday when he is scheduled to contest his 28th successive major quarter-final against Czech seventh seed Tomas Berdych, a 6-3 7-5 6-3 winner over 2013 runner-up David Ferrer.Austrian tyro Dominic Thiem was enjoying his most successful run at a grand slam after beating Spaniard Marcel Granollers 6-2 6-7(2) 6-1 6-4 to set up a last-eight clash with Belgian David Goffin.Venus Williams' eighth-seeded conqueror Bacsinszky, describing herself as ""a chameleon"" who can adapt to ""every type of court"", will next face Dutch outsider Kiki Bertens who downed American 15th seed Madison Keys 7-6(4) 6-3.Already in the semi-finals though are Spanish fourth seed Garbine Muguruza and 2011 U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur.Fourth seed Muguruza ended the run of 108th-ranked American Shelby Rogers with a 7-5 6-3 win, while 2010 Paris finalist Stosur beat Bulgaria's Tsvetana Pironkova 6-4 7-6(6).",06-02-2016,Djokovic enters 100 million dollar club Serena plays catch u,tennis,,Berdych;Bautista Agut;Marcel Granollers;Svitolina;Albert;Roberto Bautista Agut;Tsvetana;Garbine;Timea Bacsinszky;Garros;Guy;Tomas Berdych;Tiger Woods;Roberto;Lennox;Goffin.Venus;Venus;Tomas;Keys;Woods;David;Shelby;Stosur;Andy;Guy Forget;David Ferrer.Austrian;Marcel;Muguruza;Sam;Lennox Lewis;Garbine Muguruza;Elina Svitolina;Madison;Timea;Rogers;Bacsinszky;Stan;Forget;Pironkova;Elina;Albert Ramos;Murray;Wawrinka;Tsvetana Pironkova;Tiger;Bautista;Roland Garros;Ferrer.Austrian;Kiki Bertens;Williams;Ramos;Yulia;Bertens;David Goffin.Venus Williams;Sam Stosur.Fourth;Richard;Yulia Putintseva.In;Novak;Andy Murray;Dominic;Djokovic;Gasquet;Granollers;Thiem;Venus Williams;Putintseva.In;Roland;Dominic Thiem;Madison Keys;Stosur.Fourth;Lewis;Novak Djokovic;Shelby Rogers;Agut;Stan Wawrinka;Richard Gasquet;Kiki,Djokovic;Serena;Novak Djokovic,
"LONDON: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has admitted that it often tweaks the draws of major events to get Pakistan and India into the same group.The draw for the 2017 Champions Trophy in England saw India and Pakistan being grouped together, with defending champions India beginning their title defence against their arch-rivals at Edgbaston on June 4.""No doubt, we try to put Pakistan versus India in our event,"" said ICC chief executive Dave Richardson, according to a report published in The Telegraph.""It's hugely important from an ICC point of view. It's massive around the world and the fans have come to expect it as well. It's fantastic for the tournament because it gives it a massive kick.""It is the fifth tournament in succession where Pakistan and India are scheduled to meet in the group stage. Matches between the two countries attract huge television audiences, sometimes up to one billion. It had long been suspected that the ICC was doctoring draws to guarantee fans and broadcasters regular opportunities to savour cricket's most lucrative fixture, but this is the first time that the governing body has admitted it publicly.Richardson denied that the 'tweaking' impacted the integrity of any tournament. ""What we try and do is make sure that when you add up the rankings of the different groups, they all add up to the same number of points. You can do that in a number of ways.

"London: International Cricket Council chief executive David Richardson expects Pakistan quick bowler Mohammad Amir to tour England next month, saying his return is a ""good thing"" for the sport.Amir, 24, featured in two one-day internationals against New Zealand in January and the Pakistan Cricket Board have approached their English counterparts for help in securing a visa for the talented left-armer.He was given a six-month prison sentence, of which he served half in a UK young offenders institute, on charges of conspiracy to accept corrupt payments and conspiracy to cheat at gambling after bowling deliberate no-balls during the Lords Test in August 2010.The same spot-fixing scandal also saw fellow paceman Mohammad Asif and then Pakistan Test captain Salman Butt given jail sentences by an English court and bans by the ICC.Although now cleared to play again by the ICC, Amirs criminal conviction could see him denied an entry visa to Britain for Pakistans tour of England, where they will play four Tests -- the first at Lords -- five one-day internationals and a Twenty20 between July and September.""I always think you get handed out your punishment, you serve it and then who are we to say never again?,"" Richardson told AFP in an interview at The Oval in south London on Wednesday following the launch of the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy one-day tournament.""He (Amir) has certainly shown a willingness to make sure he sets an example now by asking younger players to learn from his mistakes.""Certainly, I think its a good thing that hes back playing,"" the 56-year-old added.""Id be surprised if he (Amir) doesnt end up coming (to England).""",06-02-2016,ICC chief backs Amir to tour England,cricket,London,David Richardson;Mohammad Asif;Mohammad Amir;Amir;Butt;Mohammad;Asif;Richardson;Salman;David;Salman Butt,Amir;Mohammad Amir,International Cricket Council;Pakistan Cricket Board;ICC;Amirs;AFP

"LONDON: Indias Anil Kumble and several other former Test players on an International Cricket Council committee have urged the sports law-makers to bring in new restrictions on the size of bats amid concerns over a glut of run-scoring.Following a two-day meeting at Lords, the headquarters of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the ICC cricket committee chaired by Kumble issued a statement saying it wanted MCC, which still has overall global responsibility for crickets Laws or rules, to instigate a clampdown.While there are limitations on bat length (when the lower portion of the handle is inserted it shall not be more than 38in/96.5cm) and width (4.25in/10.8cm at its widest part), none currently exist on depth.Modern manufacturers have become increasingly skilled at making bats with larger sweet spots that do not feel as heavy to pick-up as the blades that were once only the preserve of 1980s power-hitters such as West Indies great Clive Lloyd and England hero Ian Botham.The balance between bat and ball has become especially loaded against bowlers in limited overs games where the innovations brought in by Twenty20 cricket, allied to increasingly short boundaries, have led to an orgy of run-scoring.Last years 50-over World Cup in Australia and New Zealand witnessed 38 hundreds, nearly one every game, and 463 sixes, an average of one every nine overs.West Indies Chris Gayle struck 16 sixes in racing to the fastest one-day international double hundred during a World Cup match against Zimbabwe at Canberras Manuka Oval, while New Zealands Martin Guptill hit a six measured at 110 metres in the course of his 237 against the West Indies at Wellington.Thursdays statement from the ICC cricket committee, whose members include several former Test batsmen in Englands Andrew Strauss, Indias Rahul Dravid and Sri Lankas Mahela Jayawardene, said: ""MCC sought the committees guidance on the desirability of making changes in order to redress the balance between bat and ball.""The committee received a research paper from MCC citing a wealth of scientific and statistical evidence showing bats have become more powerful in recent years, primarily due to having larger sweet-spots.""It added: ""The committees view was that MCC should strongly consider limiting the dimensions of cricket bats to help achieve a better balance between bat and ball.""South Africa batting great Barry Richards, speaking during last years World Cup, said restrictions were urgently needed to bring modern-day bats into line with the kind of relatively slim models he used in his 1970s heyday.""The pressing of cricket bats has to be controlled and the thickness in their edges.

"NEW DELHI: Test teams are excessively exploiting home advantage by preparing pitches that favour the strengths of the host nation, an International Cricket Council (ICC) panel representing various stakeholders within the sport said on Friday.India manipulated conditions to thump South Africa 3-0 last year amid dissatisfaction over the nature of the turning tracks used in the series, including the strip in Nagpur which was rated poor by match referee Jeff Crowe.The ICC Cricket Committee, headed by former India captain Anil Kumble, is unhappy with the quality of test pitches ""and in particular the common practice of home countries overtly preparing surfaces to suit their own teams"".The panel was also worried about the growing imbalance between bat and ball and has requested the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the custodians of the games laws, to curb the use of oversized bats.""The Committee received a research paper from MCC citing a wealth of scientific and statistical evidence showing bats have become more powerful in recent years, primarily due to having larger sweet-spots.""The committees view was that MCC should strongly consider limiting the dimensions of cricket bats to help achieve a better balance between bat and ball.""During the two-day meeting which concluded at Lords on Wednesday, ICC medical consultant Craig Ranson made a presentation to the panel on injury surveillance trends.The committee recommended toughening helmet standards, an issue that has assumed more importance following Australian batsman Phillip Hughes death in 2014 after being struck in the head by a bouncer.""The committee expressed concerns that there were still too many instances of international cricketers wearing helmets which did not meet the latest British Safety Standard (BSS),"" it said.""It recommended that the ICC should enforce the wearing of the latest BSS compliant helmets in all international cricket.""Comprising representatives of various interested associates, the panel makes recommendations to the ICC Chief Executives Committee and the ICC Board for approval.",06-03-2016,ICC panel concerns home advantage tests Indi,cricket,NEW DELHI,Hughes;Kumble;Crowe.The;Ranson;Anil;Craig Ranson;Craig;Jeff Crowe.The;Jeff;Phillip Hughes;Phillip;Anil Kumble,,ICC Cricket Committee;BSS;ICC Chief Executives Committee;ICC;Marylebone Cricket Club;ICC Board;MCC;Committee;International Cricket Council;Safety Standard

He remained the 'King of Swing' throughout his 19 year long career.In his cricketing career that spanned over almost two decades Wasim has taken a whooping 916 international wickets and to date continues to be an inspiration to aspiring cricketers.Wasim, considered to be the most prolific Pakistani fast bowler to have ever played the game, picked up an impressive 414 wickets in 104 test matches while in ODIs, he has notched up 502 wickets in the 356 matches that he played for Pakistan.At blistering pace, Wasim Akram's reverse swing deliveries bamboozled batsmen around the world and made him one of the most respected cricketers of all time. He also has the honour of being part of the 1992 World Cup-winning Pakistan cricket team, led by Imran Khan. Akram's three wickets in the final helped Pakistan clinch the match and the world cup.Wasim Akram captained Pakistan briefly after Imran Khan and Javed Miandad retired and led his side to the world cup final in 1999 but since then, match-fixing allegations and complications got in the way of his captaining the side ever again.

"World number ones Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams will feel like they are working overtime on Friday when organisers cram all four semi-finals into a single session to try and ensure a rain-ravaged tournament ends on schedule.The Serbian will be on court for a fourth day running and the American for a third, after the players' usual rest days between matches were eaten up by persistent rain delays that washed out Monday and meant just two hours of play were possible on Tuesday.The Serbian will also have to trade down to Roland Garros' number two court to battle past his young Austrian opponent, Dominic Thiem. The 13th seed has lost both their encounters but is strengthening his case with every win to be viewed as the pick of a new tennis generation.""He's playing the best tennis of his life,"" Djokovic told a news conference on Thursday after dispatching Czech Tomas Berdych in straight sets.""He's played a lot of matches, especially on clay, which is his favourite surface... I'm sure he's going to give it all in the semis.""Weather permitting, all semi-finals at grand slam tournaments are invariably played on the main showcourt, but the scheduling backlog means Djokovic and Thiem, and before them Spanish women's fourth seed Garbine Muguruza and Australian Sam Stosur, will play Friday's matches on Court Suzanne Lenglen.Taking pride of place on Paris' main Philippe Chatrier showcourt will be Williams and unseeded Dutchwoman Kiki Bertens, followed by arguably the most mouthwatering clash of the day between world number two Andy Murray and defending champion Stan Wawrinka.""I think he's been an amazing player for many, many years,"" Wawrinka told reporters about Murray, who has won eight of their 15 encounters.""He always tries to be a better player. The way he's improved on clay is quite impressive, because now he's winning a lot of tournaments.""Both the Swiss and the Briton have had the luxury of an extra day's rest, having completed their fourth-round matches on Sunday before the rain set in.But while Djokovic, who along with Thiem did not clear the fourth round until Wednesday, is keenly aware he has had less time to recharge his batteries, that may just make him concentrate all the harder.""The way that the schedule has been going on in the second week means there is not much time to really reflect on what you have done,"" he said.""My focus right away goes for recovery and the next match.""",06-03-2016,Djokovic Serena face overtime as Paris finals b,tennis,,Garbine Muguruza;Philippe Chatrier;Berdych;Chatrier;Stan;Murray;Wawrinka;Roland Garros;Kiki Bertens;Williams;Suzanne Lenglen;Bertens;Sam Stosur;Novak;Philippe;Dominic;Andy Murray;Garbine;Serena Williams;Djokovic;Garros;Tomas Berdych;Thiem;Suzanne;Lenglen;Roland;Dominic Thiem;Novak Djokovic;Tomas;Stosur;Stan Wawrinka;Muguruza;Andy;Serena;Sam;Kiki,Djokovic Serena,
"NEW DELHI: When Ramazan starts, Imran Tahir will begin juggling the demands of observing his Muslim faith and playing a full day of international cricket for a team sponsored by a beer company.""I dont think it is difficult to balance professional sports with practising your faith,"" insisted the South Africa legspinner, in an interview with AFP.""It is very easy if you follow the right path.""One of the worlds top spinners, Pakistan-born Tahir has played more than 100 times for the Proteas since making his international debut in 2011, after becoming a South African citizen through marriage.In his native Pakistan, the team regularly prays together on the field during internationals and the lunch break is extended on Fridays, so players and fans can attend the weekly services at the nearest mosque.And in Bangladesh, the only other Muslim-majority Test-playing nation, facilities have been set aside to enable fans to pray at the ground.Tahir is one of five Muslims to have been selected for the South African squad taking part in the tri-nation ODI series with the West Indies and Australia in the Caribbean that begins on Friday and runs until June 26.strong>- Lager logo -</strongThey include former skipper Hashim Amla, who along with Tahir has been given special dispensation not to sport the logo of Castle lager, the teams major sponsor, as Muslims are forbidden from drinking alcohol.Muslims are normally expected to fast from dawn to dusk during the month of Ramadan, which begins in different parts of the world this coming Sunday or Monday.But they are allowed to refrain from fasting if they are away from home, as in the case of Tahir while he is in the West Indies.Tahir said that even if he did not observe a fast on a particular match day, he would still make it up at a later stage.""I am thankful to Allah that he drove me closer to him,"" Tahir said, during the just-finished Indian Premier League.""I try not to miss my prayers and the 30 fasts in Ramadan but even if I do miss them due to my cricket, I make up for them later on.""The Lahore-born Tahir has plied his trade around the world, including stints in Englands county championship and the IPL, where he played for the Delhi Daredevils.Speaking to AFP in the Indian capital, Tahir said that many in the cricketing fraternity helped him observe his faith.""I have come through all the different cultures of the world while playing cricket and I have had no difficulty whatsoever while following my path,"" he said, glancing at the clock to ensure he wouldnt be late for Friday prayers.""Rather they (players, coaches and support staff) give more respect.

"PARIS: Garbine Muguruza achieved the rare feat of overpowering Serena Williams to claim her maiden grand slam title with a 7-5 6-4 win over the world number one and defending champion in the French Open final on Saturday.The 22-year-old fourth seed, who lost to Williams in last years Wimbledon final, became the first Spaniard to lift the Suzanne Lenglen Cup since Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in 1998.""This is the big tournament in Spain and Rafa (Nadal) is our champion,"" she said courtside, referring to the nine-times mens winner who pulled out injured last week.""She won the first set by one point.That just goes to show you you really have to play the big points well and I think she played the big points really well,"" Williams said.Although her hard-hitting game seems more suited to faster surfaces, Muguruza won 14 consecutive sets en route to the final after losing her opening set of the tournament.An anxious player by her own admission, she managed her emotions on Court Philippe Chatrier, saving six of eight break points against Williams, who had only lost only four of her 26 previous major singles finals.It was Muguruzas first final on the slow surface and she relied on a powerful first serve and jaw-dropping winners down the line to subdue the American in a battle of will.Williams, who was gunning for a professional era record 22nd major title, got off to a solid start, winning her first service game to love and putting pressure on her opponents serve.In the fourth game, which lasted nine minutes, Muguruza saved a break point with an unreturnable forehand, then a second with an ace.An ugly double fault, however, earned Muguruza the first break of the match, which she consolidated by holding serve in the sixth game with a flat forehand winner down the line to lead 4-2.Williams, 34, stepped into the court and put Muguruza on the back foot, breaking back for 4-4 when Muguruza sent a backhand long.An unreturnable crosscourt forehand gave Muguruza another break.<br/>Serving for the set, she showed early nerves in the 12th game before converting her third opportunity with a sizzling backhand winner.A weak Williams backhand put Muguruza up a break in the second, only for the Spaniard to serve consecutive double faults as the American broke back for 1-1.But she unleashed another forehand down the line to regain the advantage and held for 3-1.Williams saved four match points to hold but on Muguruzas fifth opportunity to seal the contest in the following game she landed a lob on the base line and sank to her knees in apparent disbelief at winning the title.",06-04-2016,Muguruza overpowers Serena to win French Open ti,tennis,PARIS,Garbine Muguruza;Philippe Chatrier;Chatrier;Arantxa Sanchez Vicario;Williams;Muguruzas;Arantxa;Philippe;Vicario;Garbine;Serena Williams;Nadal;Muguruza;Sanchez;Serena,Muguruza;Serena;Garbine Muguruza;Serena Williams,
"PARIS: Serena Williams vowed to keep chasing down Steffi Grafs record of 22 Grand Slam titles after it remained once again tantalisingly out of reach thanks to Garbine Muguruzas French Open triumph on Saturday.Williamss titles count at the majors has stalled on 21 ever since she lifted a sixth Wimbledon crown last year by beating Muguruza in the final.The American star then suffered a shock semi-final loss to Italian journeywoman Roberta Vinci at the US Open before defeat to Germanys Angelique Kerber in the Australian Open title match in January.Saturdays 7-5, 6-4 loss to Muguruza, 12 years her junior, was the first time in her storied career that she had lost two successive Grand Slam finals.Muguruza, interestingly, is only the second player born in the 1990s -- after Petra Kvitova -- to win a Grand Slam.<br/>""The only thing I can do is just keep trying,"" said Williams who was attempting to win a fourth French Open after 2002, 2013 and 2015.""In Australia, Ann Kerber made 16 errors in three sets, you know, so what do you do in that situation? Today Garbine played unbelievable.""Its definitely something I want to dissect and see what I can learn from that and what can I do to get better from it.""<br/>Williams had struggled with an adductor injury at Roland Garros, a condition not helped by the unseasonal chill and damp.Despite that, she still finished top of the pile for aces served at 36 and sent down the joint fastest serve of the event at 196km/h in Saturdays final.But she had one of the lowest first serve percentage rates at 60% and managed to convert only 30 of 73 break points over the two weeks.The final, she suggested, was a reflection of her tournament as a whole.""It was just so many holes. Like I could have served better. I mean, I made a lot of errors on my return.""I did definitely try out there today, but did I play better than the other matches? Its a totally different game. But its going in the right direction, I think.""Williams believes Muguruza, the first Spanish woman since Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in 1998 to win a Grand Slam, has the game to build further on her Roland Garros breakthrough.""I think she has a bright future, obviously. She knows how to play on the big stage and she clearly knows how to win Grand Slams,"" said the American of a player who was just eight when she won her first Paris title.""Shes definitely hitting hard.

"ISLAMABAD: British boxer Amir Khan paid tribute to legendary fighter Muhammad Ali Saturday, calling him the peoples champion and saying Alis life outside the ring had inspired him to help those in need.The WBC Silver welterweight title holder, currently in Pakistan to open a boxing academy and carry out charity work, said Alis larger-than-life personality had earned him millions of fans around the globe.I was always looking up to him. A great fighter, a guy who wasnt only just a fighter but also a great personality outside the boxing world as well, the 29-year-old said.He would say Im gonna knock him out in the fourth round, and he used to do it in the fourth round. Thats what I used to love about Muhammad Ali.Khan added that Alis fighting style, which combined the speed and agility of a lightweight with the power of a heavyweight, had made him a unique fighter.If you looked at the way he used to fight he was very very different to any other fighter.He was a heavyweight, where he was really, really big, he was heavy. But he moved like a lightweight. So he floated like a butterfly and he did sting like a bee because his shots were fast, powerful and explosive. And he used to hurt his guys, you know, he hurt his opponents.In addition to being widely regarded as the best boxer in history, Ali was outspoken in his fight for social justice, becoming a key figure in the civil rights movement and a leading voice against the US war in Vietnam.He also raised millions of dollars for charity, including his own organisation dedicated to Parkinsons research, a disease he suffered from 1984 onwards.Khan said: I look up to him and I wanna do what he did. Thats why I come places like Pakistan and I spend time here.I kind of picked that out of his book  how Muhammad Ali used to help the less fortunate people. He was more of a peoples champion, not just a champion but a peoples champion and thats how I want to be.Khan has raised some $80,000 for the drought-affected people of Thar district, and pledged to build new wells in the desert region.He will also unveil a new boxing academy in the capital Islamabad aimed at unearthing future fighting champions.",06-04-2016,Amir Khan says Muhammad Ali inspired his charity wor,boxing,ISLAMABAD,Amir Khan;Khan;Amir;Muhammad;Muhammad Ali.Khan;Muhammad Ali;Ali.Khan;Ali,Muhammad Ali;Amir Khan,

A part of me slipped away, the greatest piece.""The front page headline on Alis hometown newspaper, the Courier-Journal of Louisville, Kentucky, simply said, ""The Greatest,"" with a legendary 1965 photo of Ali standing over a flattened Sonny Liston.""We lost a legend, a hero and a great man,"" said Floyd Mayweather, who retired last year as an unbeaten welterweight champion. ""Hes one of the guys who paved the way for me to be where Im at.

Madiba had great respect for his legacy and spoke with admiration of Alis achievements,"" said Sello Hatang, chief executive of the foundation.Mandelas favorite book at his office -- where there was a photo of the two men together -- was an autographed copy of an Ali biography, the organisation said.Former US president Bill Clinton said he had been ""honored"" to award Ali the Presidential Citizens Medal at the White House in January 2001, just before leaving office.""Through triumph and trials,"" Clinton said, Ali ""became even greater than his legend.""""We watched him grow from the brash self-confidence of youth and success into a manhood full of religious and political convictions that led him to make tough choices and live with the consequences.""Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called Ali ""an extraordinary athlete and a remarkable man of good deeds who conquered the hearts of millions.""""Boxing legend Muhammad Alis life-long struggle against racism and discrimination will never be forgotten,"" he wrote on Twitter.strong>Touched hearts </strongThe sporting world also united to remember one of its biggest names.

"NEW DELHI: Nita Ambani has become the first Indian woman to be nominated as a member of the International Olympic Committee, following the introduction of a new selection process.The IOC confirmed Ambanis nomination along with seven others on its website Friday, saying it was a part of its strategic roadmap for the future of the Olympic movement.Ambani, 52, will formally become an IOC member in elections slated for August 2-4 just before the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.A founder and chairperson at the Reliance Foundation, the philanthropic arm of conglomerate Reliance Industries, she is married to Mukesh Ambani, the countrys richest man.She is also the principal owner of the Mumbai Indians franchise in the Indian Premier League cricket tournament.The Indian Olympic Association said Ambanis presence on the IOC would give a big boost to sports in the country.""We welcome Nita Ambanis nomination. It is great for India and we hope... Indian sports will benefit from it,"" IOA secretary general Rajeev Mehta told AFP.Despite being the worlds second-most populous nation, India has a poor Olympic record, in part because of squabbling federations and mostly inept officials.Dogged by doping scandals and escalating costs, the IOC in 2014 passed sweeping reforms as part of a push to make Olympic Games cheaper to stage, as well as to bolster the credibility of the organisation.IOC president Thomas Bach said he hoped the eight new candidates would make great contributions to the Olympic movement, in comments posted on the IOC website.""They have been vetted by new criteria in keeping with the recommendations of Olympic Agenda 2020.""These candidates will add extra strength and diversity to our already universal orchestra of IOC members,"" Bach said.",06-04-2016,Indian businesswoman Nita Ambani nominated IOC,cricket,NEW DELHI,Thomas;Nita Ambanis;Ambanis;Thomas Bach;Rajeev Mehta;Nita;Mukesh Ambani;Rajeev;Mehta;Bach;Nita Ambani;Ambani;Mukesh,Nita Ambani,Mumbai Indians;Reliance Foundation;International Olympic Committee;Indian Premier League;Olympic Association;Reliance Industries;IOA;IOC

"LOS ANGELES: Boxing icon Muhammad Ali died on Friday, a family spokesman said in a statement.""After a 32-year battle with Parkinsons disease, Muhammad Ali has passed away at the age of 74,"" spokesman Bob Gunnell said.Ali, whose fame transcended sport during a remarkable heavyweight boxing career that spanned three decades, had been hospitalized in the Phoenix, Arizona, area with a respiratory ailment this week.Born in Louisville, Ky., in 1942, as Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr., he began boxing at the age of 12, winning a number of amateur titles, culminating in an Olympic gold medal as a light heavyweight at the 1960 Games in Tokyo. He turned pro soon after that.Early in his career, he battled societal norms as frequently as he did his opponents. In 1964, as the struggle for civil rights simmered, he knocked out heavy favorite Sonny Liston to win the heavyweight title for the first time, then told reporters that he was a member of the Nation of Islam and had changed his name to Muhammad Ali, a name many news outlets at the time were slow to recognize.By 1967, he had successfully defended the title nine times, all but two by knockout. With the Vietnam War raging, he refused induction into the U.S. Army, on religious grounds, and was arrested and charged with draft evasion. When prodded further for his reasons for resisting, he said, I am not going 10,000 miles to help murder, kill, and burn other people to simply help continue the domination of white slave-masters over dark people the world over.Though he remained free on appeal, he was stripped of his title and not allowed to box for more than three years. The conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court, unanimously, in 1971. (A 2013 film by Stephen Frears, Muhammad Alis Greatest Fight, which dramatized the courts decision, debuted in Cannes, aired on HBO in the U.S., and earned an Emmy nomination.)During his exile from the ring, Ali decided to try acting, starring in the 1969 Broadway musical Buck White at the George Abbott Theatre. He played a militant black lecturer, and got better reviews than the show, which closed after seven performances. He sings with a pleasant slightly impersonal voice, acts without embarrassment and moves with innate dignity, wrote New York Times reviewer Clive Barnes.Alis boxing career was defined by his matches against top opponents, particularly rivals Joe Frazier and George Foreman. His 1971 bout with Frazier to unify the heavyweight championship, his third after being reinstated, was called the Fight of the Century. Among those in attendance at Madison Square Garden were Miles Davis, Barbra Streisand, and Sammy Davis Jr. Bert Lancaster was the color commentator for the closed-circuit TV feed. Life Magazine hired Frank Sinatra as the photographer for Norman Mailers story.Ali had exploded the era of humble sports heroes when he declared, I am the greatest! in the run-up to his title fight with Liston. He also was among the first athletes to trash-talk his opponents, and he called Frazier, who supported the war, an Uncle Tom. Frazier knocked down Ali in the 15th round, and won a unanimous decision.Ali had to wait three years for another shot at the championship, this time against Foreman, who had beaten Frazier so badly in taking the title that few gave the 32-year-old challenger a chance against the 25-year-old champ. Ali called the fight, held in Kinshasa, Zaire, the Rumble in the Jungle. In documenting the bout 22 years later, Gasts Oscar-winning When We Were Kings showed how an ebullient Ali had arrived on the scene a few days before the taciturn Foreman, and won over the nations citizens. An impromptu entourage of hundreds followed him around chanting, Ali, bomaye! (Ali, kill him!).In 1977, Ali lent his name to a short-lived NBC animated series I Am the Greatest!: The Adventures of Muhammad Ali. Somewhat more memorably that year, he joined Sylvester Stallone  whose Rocky was to win best picture  to present the best supporting actress award to Beatrice Straight for her role in Network.In the ring, a third, brutal fight against Frazier (the Thrilla in Manilla) as well as battles with Ken Norton subjected Ali to a great deal of punishment. And though he would become the first heavyweight to reclaim the title for a third time in 1978 at age 36, when he beat 25-year-old Leon Spinks in a rematch, the wear and tear of a career in boxing was apparent.He retired, and stayed that way for two years, but ill-advisedly returned for two more bouts, with Larry Holmes and Trevor Burbick, both cringe-inducing losses.In 1996, 12 years after his Parkinsons diagnosis, Ali, showing the effects of the disease, lit the torch to begin the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. In 2005, he was presented with the Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush.Ali is survived by his fourth wife, Yolanda Lonnie Williams, two sons, and seven daughters, including Leila Ali, a boxer who retired, undefeated, in 2007.",06-04-2016,Boxing legend Muhammad Ali dies US,boxing,LOS ANGELES,Barnes.Alis;Leila Ali;Norman Mailers story.Ali;Barbra;Clive Barnes.Alis;George;Sammy;Ken Norton;Stephen Frears;Stallone;Leon;George W.

"Providence, Guyana: Sunil Narine snared career-best figures of six for 27 on his return to West Indies colours as the hosts defeated South Africa by four wickets in the opening match of the Tri-Nation One-Day International series at the Guyana National Stadium on Friday.Forced to remodel his action after it was deemed illegal during the Caribbean sides last ODI campaign in Sri Lanka last November, the 28-year-old mystery spinner was at his mesmerising best on a turgid surface where the South Africans were dismissed for 188 off 46.5 overs.They found it difficult to establish any sort of momentum despite two useful partnerships at the top of the order.Narines returns were not only a personal milestone but also the best-ever by any opponents in one-day cricket against South Africa.Kieron Pollard, back in the good graces of the West Indies selectors after 20 months in the ODI wilderness following the shock abandonment of the tour of India in October of 2014, then lifted his team to the target with 11 balls to spare with a robust unbeaten 67 that included six sixes.It was the first time in 15 years that the Caribbean side had defeated the South Africans in a one-dayer on home soil.Rilee Rossouw top scored with 61 and featured in a 78-run third-wicket partnership with skipper AB de Villiers.That effort followed an opening stand of 52 between Quinton de Kock and Hashim Amla.However the Proteas collapsed from the comparative comfort of 160 for three, their last seven wickets falling for just 28 runs with Narine befuddling the South African middle and lower order.Rossouw was one of the spinners scalps, falling to a good low catch by Carlos Brathwaite at first slip.Brathwaite had earlier broken the opening stand of de Kock and Amla, de Kock attempting an injudicious heave to be comprehensively bowled.Narine then made his first strike by trapping Amla leg-before in the very next over.Yet it was the demise of de Villiers that proved to be the most crucial.Playing well within himself and being mindful of the challenging batting conditions, he compiled 31 off 49 deliveries without a single boundary but fell to a good catch off his own bowling by pacer Jerome Taylor at the start of the 31st over.South Africa had just ended a period of 23 overs without finding the boundary rope and it appeared de Villiers and Rossouw were on the cusp of acceleration before the captains departure.From then on it was the Narine show as he scythed through the rest of the visitors batting.Set a relatively modest target, the West Indies opening pair of Johnson Charles and Andre Fletcher rode their luck in a 37-run stand before the introduction of the spinners changed the complexion of the chase.Imran Tahir deceived and bowled both with googlies while Aaron Phangiso and part-timer J.P. Duminy removed Marlon Samuels and Denesh Ramdin respectively to have the hosts wobbling at 76 for four.But Pollard, whose first three scoring shots were towering sixes, dominated a 74-run fourth-wicket stand with Darren Bravo to take the West Indies closer to the target.Bravo fell to Phangiso for 30 and Carlos Brathwaite, the final over hero of the World T20 triumph in India two months earlier, perished attempting a bit hit of Phangiso.But captain Jason Holder joined Pollard to ensure there were no more alarms on the way to a morale-boosting victory for a team classified as underdogs alongside the South Africans and ahead of Sundays meeting with World Cup holders Australia at the same venue.",06-04-2016,Narine sinks Proteas in West Indies r,cricket,Providence,de;de Kock;Sunil;Rossouw;Darren;Pollard;Jason;Charles;Denesh;Taylor;Narine;Tahir;Phangiso;Quinton;Aaron Phangiso;Samuels;Marlon Samuels;Hashim;Marlon;Ramdin;Bravo;Jerome Taylor;Johnson Charles;Quinton de Kock;Denesh Ramdin;Brathwaite;Kock;Aaron;Sunil Narine;Amla;Johnson;Andre Fletcher;Holder;Darren Bravo;Andre;Jason Holder;Fletcher;Carlos Brathwaite;Jerome;Carlos,Narine;Sunil Narine,J.P.

"ISLAMABAD:Boxer Amir Khan has denied betraying his British upbringing after being criticised for saying he would represent Pakistan at the Rio Games, insisting he only wanted to boost the sport in his parents country of birth.But the Bolton-born fighter also admitted he would not be willing to face an accompanying two-year ban from the World Boxing Council that would jeopardise his professional career, making an Olympic appearance unlikely.Speaking to AFP in an exclusive interview in Islamabad, where he launched his first boxing academy on Saturday, Khan said he was a ""proud British fighter"" who had represented his country at the Athens Games and would therefore not want to deprive fellow Brits of a ticket to Rio De Janeiro.""Im not doing it because Im not happy being British. Im a proud British fighter, but its the way people took it out of context and calling me a traitor -- I meant it in a way that Id rather give someone else an opportunity instead because Pakistan has no boxers,"" he said.""But, you know, at the moment we are just waiting and seeing. I dont think Ill be allowed to do that anyway because obviously, the WBC, they wont allow it.""World Boxing Council president Mauricio Sulaiman denounced a rule change by the International Boxing Association (AIBA) to allow professionals to compete against top amateurs in the Olympics, calling the move dangerous.Amirs announcement was also met with consternation by some fans on social media and his former promoter Frank Warren, who wrote on boxingscene.com he was ""a little disappointed"" in Khan, who rose to fame after bagging an Olympic silver medal in 2004./><strong>Stinging loss</strongThe 29-year-old stands at a critical juncture in his career following a stinging loss to Saul ""Canelo"" Alvarez last month, that took his career record to 31 wins and four losses.Khan, a two-time former welterweight world champion, stepped up two divisions to fight his brawny middleweight opponent after he was denied a coveted matchup with Floyd Mayweather, who retired last year.He got off to a lightning start, but after dominating the early rounds was caught with a powerful overhand right that put him on the canvas in the sixth.Looking more trim than he appeared during the Nevada bout, Khan was sanguine about his loss and insisted he was looking forward to his next world title shot against WBC welterweight champion Danny Garcia.""I feel great. I feel young, fresh. I mean, the Alvarez fight, everything was going fine until I got caught with the big shot and thats boxing for you sometimes. One punch can change the fight.

"SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ: The death of Muhammad Ali, the former heavyweight champion known as much for his political activism as his boxing brilliance, triggered a worldwide outpouring of affection and admiration for one of the best-known figures of the 20th century.Ali, who had long suffered from Parkinson's syndrome which impaired his speech and made the once-graceful athlete almost a prisoner in his own body, died on Friday at age 74.The cause of death was septic shock due to unspecified natural causes, a family spokesman said on Saturday.

Jesse Jackson told CNN on Saturday.Pam Dorrough, a tourist in New York's Times Square, admired Ali's refusal to apologize for what he believed.""The confidence - and I know everybody thought it was an arrogance about him - he always projected a confidence,"" she said. ""And he stood by that.""President Barack Obama, the first African-American to reach the White House, said Ali was ""a man who fought for us"" and placed him in the pantheon of civil rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr and Nelson Mandela.""His fight outside the ring would cost him his title and his public standing. It would earn him enemies on the left and the right, make him reviled, and nearly send him to jail,"" Obama said in a statement. ""But Ali stood his ground. And his victory helped us get used to the America we recognize today.""Ali's daughter Maryum said on Saturday: ""I am happy my father no longer struggles. He is in a better place. God is the greatest.""In New York's Harlem district, fans gathered outside the famous Apollo Theater, where a marquee paying tribute to Ali read: ""The greatest of all time. 1942-2016.""Nearby, hundreds more gazed at projections of phrases and images most associated with Ali, such as ""float like a butterfly and sting like a bee.""Few could argue with his athletic prowess at his peak in the 1960s, with his dancing feet and quick fists. But Ali became much more than a sportsman. He spoke boldly against racism in the '60s as well as against the Vietnam War.Ali met scores of world leaders, during and after his championship reign, and for a time he was considered the most recognizable person on earth, known even in remote villages in countries far from the United States.",06-06-2016,Muhammad Ali the greatest remembered boxer transcended spor,boxing,SCOTTSDALE,Jesse;Jackson;Jesse Jackson;Muhammad Ali;Bob;Gunnell;King;Nelson Mandela;Barack;Luther;Nelson;Maryum;Bob Gunnell;Obama;Jr;Bob Arum;Martin;Martin Luther King Jr;Barack Obama;Muhammad;Mandela;Arum;Ali,Muhammad Ali,CNN;U.S. Army
"Mexico scored twice in the final five minutes to beat Uruguay 3-1 in a pulsating Copa America Group C match in which each side had a man sent off on Sunday.The win in front of a passionate and partisan crowd at Glendale, Arizona left Mexico top of the group on goal difference from Venezuela after they beat 10-man Jamaica 1-0 in Chicago.The early omens were not good for Uruguay who stood stunned before kickoff when the Chilean national anthem was played instead of their own.Mexico then made a lightning start with the fastest goal of the tournament so far in their first incursion into the Uruguay penalty area in the fourth minute.Hector Herrera and Uruguay's Alvaro Pereira both leapt to meet Andres Guardado's curling cross from the left with the defender heading into his own net.Uruguay, who had Matias Vecino dismissed on the stroke of halftime after a second booking for a foul on Jesus Corona, equalised in the 74th minute from the free kick awarded when Guardado was also shown a second yellow card.Carlos Sanchez, the man Guardado brought down, hit the free kick into the box where captain Diego Godin headed past Alfredo Talavera to put the record 15-times champions back on level terms.Mexico, however, had the last word when their captain Rafael Marquez scored a fine goal from a corner, finding the top corner of Fernando Muslera's net with an angled shot from the right.With the Uruguayans pushing forward in numbers in search of another equaliser, Herrera made the result safe in the second minute of added time with a header from Diego Perezs neat flick across the face of goal.strong>VENEZUELAN VICTORY</strongUruguay, without injured striker Luis Suarez and on the back foot for most of the first half, missed two good chances either side of halftime.Edinson Cavani, put through by Nicolas Lodeiro, was one-on-one with Talavera but the goalkeeper closed him down and blocked his effort after 30 minutes.In the 58th minute, Godin broke into attack from his own half and laid off to his right for Cavani who crossed to fellow striker Diego Rolan on the left but his finish was poor and ended up on the wrong side of the near post.Jamaica, who have now lost all four of their Copa America matches by the same 1-0 score, had the first chance at Soldier Field when a header from Je-Vaughn Watson hit the bar in the 11th minute.Venezuela, whose highest finish at a Copa America was the 2011 semi-finals in Argentina, went ahead after 15 minutes when Alejandro Guerra set up Josef Martinez and the striker shot under goalkeeper Andre Blake.Eight minutes later, Jamaicas Rodolph Austin was sent off after he caught Tomas Rincons ankle with his studs as he followed through after winning the ball in the tackle.Jamaica's coach Winfried Schaefer was sent to the stands for the second half after a heated discussion with referee Victor Carrillo at the break.The Caribbean islanders fought hard in the second half but Michael Hector hit the post with a shot and, at the other end, Blake needed to make a superb save from Wilker Angel's diving header.Mexico play Jamaica next in Pasadena on Thursday when Uruguay meet Venezuela in Philadelphia.",06-06-2016,Two late goals give Mexico 3 1 win over Uruguay,football,Mexico,Rincons;Herrera;Martinez;Alejandro;Andres Guardado;Rafael;Je-Vaughn Watson;Blake;Vecino;Perezs;Josef;Watson;Austin;Carrillo;Pereira;Michael;Talavera;Josef Martinez;Corona;Godin;Wilker Angel;Andres;Angel;Diego;Diego Perezs;Tomas Rincons;Michael Hector;Diego Godin;Rolan;Hector;Jamaicas;Guardado;Wilker;Nicolas Lodeiro;Rafael Marquez;Luis;Tomas;Alfredo Talavera;Winfried Schaefer;Winfried;Cavani;Alvaro Pereira;Nicolas;Fernando Muslera;Matias Vecino;Victor;Victor Carrillo;Jesus;Marquez;Diego Rolan;Blake.Eight;Andre Blake.Eight;Guerra;Rodolph;Luis Suarez;Alvaro;Suarez;Matias;Alfredo;Jesus Corona;Alejandro Guerra;Andre;Je-Vaughn;Lodeiro;Fernando;Sanchez;Muslera;Jamaicas Rodolph Austin;Schaefer,,Copa America Group
"KOLKATA: Manohar Aich, the bodybuilder who became the first Indian to take the Mr. Universe title in 1952 and won the nickname Pocket Hercules for his tiny stature, has died aged 104.Aich, who stood just 1.5 metres (four feet, 11 inches) tall, started lifting weights in 1942 when he was working as a gym instructor in the Royal Indian Air Force.That job ended when he slapped a British officer who had made an offensive remark about Indians, earning him a brief jail term -- a punishment he later described as a ""blessing in disguise"".""The jailor had been very kind and allowed me to train. In fact, he encouraged it,"" Aich told the Indian Express newspaper in an interview to mark his 100th birthday.He emerged from prison as India won its independence in 1947 and decided to settle in the eastern city of Kolkata, where he turned to selling coconuts for a living.But his interest in bodybuilding continued and in 1951 he travelled to Britain to take part in the Mr. Universe competition.When he missed out on the title he decided to stay on in Britain and have another go, taking a job with British Rail. In 1952 he became the first Indian ever to win.Aich died at his home in Kolkata on Sunday, his son told AFP by phone.""Our father used to say discipline comes from within.

"For Andy Murray, reaching Sunday's French Open final was a bonus, but he was in no mood to look for silver linings in the aftermath of yet another grand slam reverse at the hands of Novak Djokovic.The second-seeded Briton's 3-6 6-1 6-2 6-4 defeat on Court Philippe Chatrier was his fifth loss in seven blue riband finals against the Serbian world number one, and his eighth out of 10 finals in all.""I was struggling. I was a couple of points from going out of the tournament in the first round,"" he told reporters.""But then when you get there (to the final) obviously you want to win. You know, I didn't do that today. Right now I'm very disappointed.""Had he turned the tables on a player he has beaten just twice in the past 14 meetings, Murray would have become the first British man to win the French Open since Fred Perry in 1935.The last of those rare Murray victories came in May's Italian Open final, also played on clay -- a surface the Scot once mistrusted but now looks increasingly at ease on -- and in the same damp conditions that dominated this year's Roland Garros fortnight.strong>Facing a Paris crowd heavily favouring his opponent in a stadium dotted on all sides with Serbian flags, the Scot managed to carry that momentum into the early part of Sunday's match -- one he said after his semi-final win over Stan Wawrinka that he had ""never expected to reach"".</strongMurray won 16 of 20 points at one stage of the first set.But after failing to convert a break point in the first game of the second set, Murray lost the initiative and Djokovic kicked into a higher gear.The Serbian faltered only at the sharp end of the match, nervously dropping serve at 5-2 as the prospect of winning his fourth major in a row began to sink in, but sealing the match two games later.strong>GRACIOUS AND WITTY</strongWhen it was all over, Murray crossed the net to embrace his rival, well aware of the immensity of an achievement he paid tribute to in a gracious, witty courtside speech.""Winning all four of the grand slams in one year is an amazing achievement. This is something that is so rare in tennis,"" he said.""...So everyone here who came to watch is obviously extremely lucky to see it. Me personally being on the opposite side, it sucks to lose the match. But I am proud to have been part of today.""Murray acknowledged that same sense of perspective might help him view his achievements in a kinder light at the end of his career, having shared top-four billing over many years with Djokovic and two other all-time greats of the game in Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Federer missed this year's tournament with a back problem and Nadal had to pull out with a wrist injury after the second round.""Obviously the guys I have been around the last few years have made things difficult for me,"" he said.""But I guess I've got a few more years to try and (win more slams). I think when I finish I will be more proud of my achievements maybe.""Meanwhile next month's Wimbledon beckons, and another chance to set the record straight -- this time on a surface on which the Serbian has never beaten him.",06-06-2016,Andy Murray tastes bittersweet loss in unexpected French Open fi,tennis,,Federer;Philippe Chatrier;Rafael;Chatrier;Stan;Murray;Wawrinka;Roland Garros;Perry;Novak;Roger;Philippe;Andy Murray;Nadal;Djokovic;Rafael Nadal;Fred Perry;Fred;Garros;Roger Federer;Scot;Roland;Stan Wawrinka;Andy,Andy Murray,

"Providence, Guyana: Australia wobbled near the finish yet still made an immediate statement in their opening match of the Tri-Nation Series at the Guyana National Stadium on Sunday, whipping the West Indies by six wickets in the second fixture of the tournament.Put in to bat on a pitch that once again made strokeplay difficult, the West Indies collapsed from the relative comfort of 50 for one to be dismissed for 116 off just 32.3overs, losing the last nine wickets for only 66 runs on the way their lowest-ever total in a One-Day International against Australia in the Caribbean.Australia then wasted little time in getting to the modest target, David Warner stroking an unbeaten 55 to ensure that the scheduled day/night fixture was over with almost 25 overs to spare despite the loss of three wickets for seven runs with the end in sight.Spinners Sunil Narine, with two wickets in one over, and Sulieman Benn caused the discomfort but it was not enough to pull the hosts back from the abyss.The emphatic victory earned Australia a bonus point to move ahead of the West Indies in the three-team standings before Tuesdays final game at Providence against South Africa.Boosted by a four-wicket win in the tournament-opener against the South Africans at the same venue two days earlier, the West Indies plummeted back down to earth at the feet of the World Cup-holders, whose frontline spinners Nathan Lyon and Adam Zampa did the bulk of the damage with three wickets apiece after the usual effective opening burst from Mitchell Starc.Playing his first international match for more than six months after being sidelined by injury, the left-arm fast bowler breached the defences of openers Andre Fletcher and Johnson Charles to finish with figures of two for 37 from nine overs.He showed signs of rustiness in delivering five wides and a no-ball, however his lethal pace proved more than a handful for the West Indies top order.Starcs tally of ODI wickets is now at 92 in his 47th match and should he take eight more before the end of this competition he will eclipse Pakistans Saqlain Mustaq for the record as the fastest to 100 wickets in terms of matches played in this format of the international game.Charles topscored with a chancy 22 while all-rounder Carlos Brathwaite was last out for 21, Aaron Finch taking the catch at long-on to give Zampa his third wicket.Notwithstanding the turgid surface, the home batsmen contributed to their swift demise with a succession of poor shots, exemplified by Darren Bravos loose cover-drive at seamer Mitchell Marsh which offered a straightforward catch to Zampa at cover.Lyon, the experienced off-spinner, had an almost instant impact in disposing of Marlon Samuels and Kieron Pollard off successive deliveries. Pollard, whose unbeaten 67 guided the West Indies to victory over the Proteas two days earlier, attempted a heave over long-on to be taken by Warner on the boundary.Jason Holder gave mystery spinner Narine first use of the new ball from one end in hopes of an immediate breakthrough at the start of the Australian reply, but it was left to the captain to separate the opening pair as Warner and Finch got off to a flying start with a succession of boundaries on both sides of the wicket.They had put on 44 by the eighth over when Finch was leg-before for 19 in Holders first over, giving the gangling Barbadian his 50th wicket in One-Day International cricket.",06-06-2016,Warner half century as Australia thrash Windi,cricket,Providence,Mitchell Marsh;Johnson Charles;Sunil;Saqlain;Brathwaite;Aaron;Warner;Saqlain Mustaq;Mustaq;Nathan;Darren;Aaron Finch;Pollard;Sulieman Benn;Zampa;Mitchell;Sunil Narine;Finch;David Warner;Bravos;Charles;Andre Fletcher;Johnson;Darren Bravos;Narine;Lyon;Sulieman;Andre;Nathan Lyon;Adam;Adam Zampa;Samuels;Kieron Pollard;David;Kieron;Marsh;Fletcher;Marlon Samuels;Carlos Brathwaite;Benn;Marlon;Carlos,,Warner
"NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES: The death of boxing great Muhammad Ali cost American Muslims perhaps their greatest hero, a goodwill ambassador for Islam in a country where their minority faith is widely misunderstand and mistrusted.""We thank God for him,"" Talib Shareef, president and imam of the Masjid Muhammad mosque in Washington, told a gathering of Muslim leaders who honored Ali in Washington on Saturday, a day after he died in a Phoenix hospital at age 74. ""America should thank God for him. He was an American hero.""From the turmoil of civil rights and black Muslim movements of the 1960s to the darkest days after Sept. 11, 2001, Ali was a hero that U.S. Muslims could share with part of the American mainstream.Muslims remembered Ali for many familiar reasons, hailing him as a champion of social justice, a lifelong supporter of charitable works and an opponent of the U.S. war in Vietnam.Moreover, they said, he was a Muslim that a largely Christian country came to admire, even if Ali shocked and scared much of U.S. society after he joined the Nation of Islam and changed his name from Cassius Clay in 1964.""When we look at the history of the African-American community, one important factor in popularizing Islam in America is Muhammad Ali,"" Warith Deen Mohammed II, son of the former Nation of Islam leader, said in a statement.With some 3.3 million adherents in the United States, Muslims make up about 1 percent of the population, largely immigrants and African-Americans who have embraced the religion.Although they have integrated into society better than some of their brethren in Europe, American Muslims face hardships even as the United State grows demographically less white and less Christian.Since 2001, they have suffered backlash from those Americans who equate all Muslims with those who have attacked civilians out of some jihadist cause.Decades before, black Muslim leaders such as Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X rattled the white establishment as religious and ethnic minorities who demanded equality for their people. Elijah Mohammad preached a version that denounced white oppression and opposed integration of the races.Ali came to be widely revered, but there was a time when he was rejected, mostly by whites by also by some black leaders for his bold statements against white supremacy and for his refusal to embrace the model epitomized by Martin Luther King, a Christian.""The sanitizing of Ali's image in recent years has led many to forget that he was reviled by many during the 1960s for his conversion to Islam and for his refusal to be inducted into the U.S. armed forces,"" said Frank Guridy, a visiting associate professor of history at Columbia University.""He was seen as a traitor to the United States of America.""In the 1970s, Ali converted to Sunni Islam, the largest denomination among Muslims worldwide, and embraced Sufism, a mystical school of the faith.At the gathering of Muslim-American leaders in Washington, speaker after speaker remembered him fondly as the Muslim who Americans came to love.Ali defended Muslims last December, after Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump proposed temporarily stopping Muslims from entering the country in the wake of militant attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California.""Our political leaders should use their position to bring understanding about the religion of Islam, and clarify that these misguided murderers have perverted people's views on what Islam really is,"" Ali said in a statement.He also used his influence to advocate the release of Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter who spent 18 months in a Iranian prison, and for Daniel Pearl, a Wall Street Journal reporter who was captured by extremists in Pakistan and later beheaded in 2002.""Muhammad Ali was a gift from God,"" said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, ""not only to Muslims but to the world.""",06-06-2016,American Muslims remember Ali as hero for their fai,boxing,NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES,Martin Luther King;Shareef;King;Talib;Jason;Luther;II;Rezaian;Daniel Pearl;Deen;Daniel;Nihad;Elijah;Trump;Pearl;Talib Shareef;Elijah Mohammad;Elijah Muhammad;Malcolm;Donald Trump;Warith Deen Mohammed II;Donald;Frank Guridy;Muhammad Ali;Warith;Guridy;X;Jason Rezaian;Malcolm X;Nihad Awad;Awad;Mohammed;Martin;Mohammad;Muhammad;Frank;Ali,Ali;Muhammad Ali,Muslims;Washington Post;American Muslims;Columbia University;Islam;Nation of Islam;Wall Street Journal;Cassius Clay

"SYDNEY: As the humble daughter of factory workers at a Bangkok sweet-maker, badminton was a ticket out of poverty for Ratchanok Intanon, who hopes winning gold at the Rio Olympics might inspire more Thai girls to chase their dreams.The 21-year-old will be among Thailand's main medal hopes in Brazil and one of the chief threats to China's chances of defending their astonishing sweep of all five badminton titles at the London Games.Ratchanok is spurred by a painful memory of London, where, as a teenage sensation set to rock the Chinese establishment, she choked in a quarter-final when poised to defeat the tournament second seed, Wang Xin.""Actually I think I had a chance to win or (be) close to the medals,"" Ratchanok told Reuters ruefully in an interview in Sydney on Tuesday.""But I think I lost with the experience, because that time I was still young and she was also good, world class.""So maybe... mentally she was better than me.""That time, I didn't feel good after losing.

Just learn more.""Ratchanok did not wallow for too long.The following year, she became badminton's youngest world champion at the age of 18 when she stunned Olympic champion Li Xuerui in the final of her home tournament in Guangzhou.Ratchanok may face Li this week at the Australian Badminton Open, the last major meeting before the Olympic tournament starts Aug. 11.strong>CONFIDENT OF SUCCESS</strongRatchanok has had injury troubles and dips in form since her world title but has been in ominous condition in recent months, capturing three consecutive Superseries tournaments to rise to the world number one ranking in April.She has since conceded it to Spain's two-time world champion Carolina Marin but her brief spell at the top sent Thailand into a frenzy.Rather than shy away from the hype, Ratchanok has embraced the expectation.""I hope that I can get the gold medal for Thailand,"" said Ratchanok, standing on a terrace at her hotel adjacent to Olympic stadiums built for the 2000 Sydney Games.""It's not too difficult for me and I believe that I can do it.""Ratchanok had an unusual route into badminton, being handed a racquet at the age of six and told to go play outside the factory where her parents worked making sweet Thai desserts.Her tournament winnings and endorsements have been enough to help her parents start their own food business, while her achievements have won her friends in high places.After becoming Thailand's first world number one, Ratchanok played a game with Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha during a visit to government house.During the meeting she asked him if her Chinese coach's application to become a Thai citizen could be expedited, local media reported.Xie Zhuhua, who once battled China's current head coach Li Yongbo during competition in the 1990s, has coached Ratchanok since her junior days and is seen as key to her ability to unlock the games of her Chinese rivals.""He just takes care of me like I'm his daughter, because he also doesn't have (one),"" Ratchanok said of their special relationship.""He loves me like a daughter and takes care of me. For me, he's like a second father, so I just do my best.""",06-07-2016,Gold would sweet factory girl Ratchanok Thailand,badminton,SYDNEY,Prayuth;Marin;Wang;Chan-ocha;Prayuth Chan-ocha;Yongbo;Ratchanok;Xuerui;Ratchanok Intanon;Li;Carolina Marin;Carolina;Wang Xin;Intanon;Xin;Li Yongbo;Li Xuerui,,Reuters
"Neymar could follow FC Barcelona fellow star Lionel Messi to court after Spanish prosecutors asked for the Brazilian striker to be tried over his murky multi-million-euro transfer to the Catalan giants.Prosecutors from Spains top criminal court accuse the 24-year-old, his father, Barcas ex-president Sandro Rosell and the club itself of concealing the true cost of his 2013 transfer deal from Brazils Santos to FC Barcelona, a judicial source said Tuesday.If the case comes to trial, Neymar will be the second Barcelona star to take the stand after Lionel Messi appeared in court earlier this month on charges of tax fraud related to income earned from his image rights.Brazilian investment fund DIS, which held 40 percent of Neymars sporting rights when he played at Santos, claims it was cheated of its real share of the transfer due to parallel contracts that Barcelona and Santos allegedly used to hide the total cost.They also believe a pre-contract agreement between Neymar and Barca impeded other clubs from making offers for the player, affecting the value of the transfer fee.The deal was originally valued at 57.1 million euros ($64.9 million) by Barca, 40 million of which was paid to the N&amp;N company owned by the players father.Santos -- where Neymar started his career -- received 17.1 million, 6.8 million euros of which went to DIS.However, Spanish judicial authorities have estimated the number of simultaneous deals in the transfer amounted to at least 83.3 million euros -- with the difference allegedly going to Neymar and his family, and Santos.Rosell resigned from Barcelona in 2014 over the affair.The club was also indicted for alleged tax fraud linked to the signing, and made a voluntary tax payment of 13.5 million euros.So far though no trial has been held.strong>- Corruption, fraud -</strongThe Brazilian football star and his father have in the past defended themselves in the media.""Before saying nonsense -- that we hid this, or hid that -- they should prove it,"" Neymar told Brazilian TV station Globo in February, when he was called to give evidence to a judge in Madrid.""My father is doing everything to ensure that I can just focus on playing football. He handles the books. But in the moment when you see someone you love suffering, it starts to hurt.""Prosecutors want Neymar, his father Neymar Da Silva Santos, Rosell and FC Barcelona itself to be tried for ""corruption,"" said the judicial source, who refused to be named.If the case comes to trial, Neymar faces a six-month to two-year prison sentence, as well as fines.Prosecutors also want Rosell, FC Barcelona, Brazils Santos and its president to be tried for ""fraud.""Neymars mother Nadine, meanwhile, could also be tried for having profited financially from the alleged fraudulent transfer.The player gave evidence to a judge in Spain in February as part of the probe into his transfer, as did his father.That same month, investigators in Brazil also launched proceedings against the football star and his father over the same case.Brazils federal prosecution service accused them of forging contracts to pay less tax.But a judge subsequently threw the tax fraud charges out, arguing that the case could not go ahead while tax authorities had yet to complete their probe.",06-07-2016,Football Spain prosecutors seek Neymar corruption tri,football,,Sandro;Lionel;Rosell;Nadine;Lionel Messi;Da;Silva;Sandro Rosell;Barcas;Santos;Neymar Da Silva Santos;Messi;Neymar,,FC Barcelona;Barcelona;Globo;Santos;Brazils Santos;Barca
"With an ego the size of his imposing physique, Zlatan Ibrahimovic says he could use his image to boost the dismal ratings of French President Francois Hollande - but then he might not choose to do so.Not known for his modesty, Sweden's larger-than-life soccer captain announced his departure from French club Paris Saint Germain last month with the words: ""I came like a king, left like a legend.""""I can make him popular if I want, but I am not sure I want to,"" he was quoted as saying of Hollande in an interview published by Le Monde newspaper on Tuesday.Ibrahimovic made his comment on the eve of the opening of the Euro 2016 soccer championships in France when he will turn out for Sweden. Since the striker has now left PSG and may be joining another team outside France it was not clear how he thought it was within his power to help Hollande.Asked if Hollande, France's most unpopular leader since the beginning of the Fifth Republic in 1958, should target a second term next year, Ibrahimovic said: ""To be honest, I don't know if he's done a good job. But that's for you, the French, to say.""The 34-year-old Swede joined PSG in 2012, the same year Hollande arrived in the Elysee presidential palace, and added four Ligue 1 titles to an already loaded trophy cabinet.Hollande, meanwhile, has had a rougher ride.

"JOHANNESBURG: An Edgar Salli thunderbolt gave Cameroon a 1- 0 victory in Mauritania Friday and a place at the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations to be hosted by Gabon.The diminutive 23-year-old midfielder from Swiss club Saint Gallen struck on the halfhour mark at a packed 10 000seat national stadium in the Mauritanian capital Nouakchott.Mauritania failed to clear a freekick and Salli pounced on the loose ball just outside the penalty area and slammed it past diving goalkeeper Souleymane Diallo.The home team who began the match one point behind the visitors pressed continuously for an equaliser after halftime.But hopes of drawing level were dealt a huge blow on 68 minutes when defender Moustapha Diaw was redcarded after clashing with striker Karl Toko.Frustrated supporters in a predominantly proMauritania crowd hurled missiles at the Cameroon bench in the closing stages and one struck Belgium-born coach Hugo Broos.Victory lifted Cameroon to 11 points in Group M and an unassailable fourpoint advantage over Mauritania as each country has only one fixture to play.South Africa (three points) are away to Gambia (two points) in Bakau Saturday with only pride at stake.Fourtime African champions Cameroon are the third country to qualify for the 16-team Cup of Nations after Morocco and Algeria.Morocco secured a place during March by beating Cape Verde twice within four days and Algeria booked their place Thursday through a 2-0 win in the Seychelles.The Moroccans dropped their first points and conceded a first goal in Group F when Libya snatched a stoppagetime goal to draw 1-1 in Tunis.Nabil Dirar scored off a halfvolley after a corner to give Morocco a first-half lead and Sanad Ouerfelli levelled by heading a freekick past goalkeeper Munir Mohamedi.A home fixture for Libya it was switched to Tunisia because of militiainstigated postMoamer Kadhafi era lawlessness Former champions Tunisia took a significant step toward qualifying by winning 3-0 away to Group A whipping boys Djibouti.Naim Sliti and Hamdi Harbaoui scored during the opening half in the tiny Horn of Africa state and Taha Yassine Khenissi added a third goal just before the hour mark.Leaders Tunisia have 10 points from five matches, one more than Liberia who host thirdplace Togo in Monrovia Sunday.Whatever the result of the West African clash, Tunisia will win the section if they beat visiting Liberia during September.",06-07-2016,Salli thunderbolt takes Cameroon to Africa Cu,football,JOHANNESBURG,Kadhafi;Sliti;Edgar;Moustapha;Djibouti.Naim;Yassine;Salli;Sanad Ouerfelli;Ouerfelli;Munir Mohamedi.A;Hamdi Harbaoui;Gallen;Karl Toko.Frustrated;Souleymane Diallo.The;Karl;Mohamedi.A;Edgar Salli;Sanad;Moamer Kadhafi;Hamdi;Taha Yassine Khenissi;Broos.Victory;Hugo Broos.Victory;Djibouti.Naim Sliti;Taha;Moustapha Diaw;Harbaoui;Souleymane;Diallo.The;Moamer;Hugo;Diaw;Munir;Toko.Frustrated;Khenissi,Salli;Edgar Salli,Africa Cup of Nations;Tunis.Nabil Dirar
"LONDON: The record books were rewritten twice in an astonishing run spree at Nottinghamshire's Trent Bridge ground on Monday which saw a record English one-day partnership and the most aggregate runs scored in a List A match.By the close in the Royal London One-Day Cup game between Notts and Northamptonshire, statisticians were checking to see if there had ever been a day like it anywhere in the world.The big hitting began from the start with Nottinghamshire's Riki Wessels and Michael Lumb sharing a record one-day partnership in England of 342 from 39.2 overs.Wessels eventually departed for a career-best 146, from 97 balls, while Lumb went on to make 184, also his best and a record for the county, as Nottinghamshire posted 445 for 8, the second highest score for a List A match in the world.The runs continued to flow when Northamptonshire chased down what would have been another record for a team batting second. But they fell short despite 128 from Rory Kleinveldt.Their total of 425 gave Nottinghamshire victory by 20 runs in a game which saw an unprecedented 870 runs scored in the day, three more than Surrey and Glamorgan managed in 2002.Afterwards Lumb joked: ""It was a bit twitchy. What a great game of cricket. Never in doubt.""I was surprised they took it that deep but it's credit to them. Rory Kleinveldt was unbelievable. It was an unbelievable game. I don't think we could do too much more. I'm proud of all the boys.""The Nottinghamshire stand beat the previous record in England of 318 by Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid for India against Sri Lanka at Taunton in the 1999 World Cup.Lumb and Wessels' English record is the third-highest partnership in List A games, behind the 372 which Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels took off Zimbabwe in the 2015 World Cup.The record for the highest team total is held by Surrey, who made 496-4 against Gloucestershire in 2007.List A matches are played over 40-60 overs.",06-07-2016,Records tumble in English county one day g,cricket,LONDON,Rory;Dravid;Rory Kleinveldt;Kleinveldt.Their;Riki Wessels;Riki;Chris;Michael;Rory Kleinveldt.Their;Lumb;Rahul Dravid;Rahul;Chris Gayle;Gayle;Kleinveldt;Ganguly;Samuels;Sourav Ganguly;Marlon Samuels;Sourav;Marlon;Michael Lumb;Wessels,,Northamptonshire;Glamorgan;Royal London;Gloucestershire;Nottinghamshire;Surrey

"LONDON: Stuart Broad has insisted he wont have any issues playing against Mohammad Amir should the convicted spot-fixer make his Test return at Lords next month.Lords was the venue six years ago when left-arm quick bowler Amir and two Pakistan team-mates were involved in the deliberate bowling of no-balls as part of a newspaper sting operation to demonstrate the trios willingness to take part in spot-fixing.A teenager at the time and one of world crickets undoubted rising stars, Amir was sent to jail by an English court and banned from all cricket worldwide for five years.He has now served that ban and, unlike 2010 Pakistan captain Salman Butt and fellow paceman Mohammad Asif, Amir has now been included in the squad for a four-Test series starting at Lords on July 14.Team officials are optimistic the 24-year-old will receive his British visa in the next couple of days following a special request for leniency from the Pakistan Cricket Board.The 2010 match, which England won by an innings, is now best remembered for the spot-fixing controversy rather than Broads impressive 169  his lone Test hundred  could rankle with the England fast-medium bowler.But Broad, speaking at an event organised by England sponsor Hardys wine on Monday, said: ""I dont think any feelings will be dragged into this Test match from that one.""There are only four players in (this) England team from then, and Pakistan had a huge change-over. So I dont think any ill-feeling or negativity from the players will have carried through.""Turning to Amirs possible return, Broad said: ""I think hes served his time. For quality of bowler, I dont think there is much doubt that he is up there with anyone.""Ive not played him for six years, but in 2010 he was a constant threat and man of the series. It swung round corners for him.""However, citing the reaction of spectators at Lords to England all-rounder Ben Stokes controversial dismissal for obstructing the field in a one-day international against Australia last year, Broad said spectators at the home of cricket may not welcome Amir back with open arms.""The crowd might be a different story. There was a lively reaction to Ben Stokes dismissal last year to Mitchell Starc, and it looked like a nasty atmosphere for a while.""strong>Result devalued</strongAs for his 2010 hundred  which surpassed the highest Test score achieved by his father Chris, a former England opening batsman  Broad does not feel it was tainted by the spot-fixing furore.""I do look back at it, and Im very proud of scoring a hundred at Lords  and beating my dads highest score.""""Its certainly not devalued in my mind. I still scored those runs and (Im) still on the honours board.""Nevertheless, he added: ""I think the result was devalued. We couldnt celebrate  we didnt celebrate  it was all a very strange time.""The one-day series that followed was quite unpleasant, and the crowds reflected the bad feeling.""The ongoing England-Sri Lanka series has seen Broad displaced as the worlds top-ranked Test bowler by new-ball colleague James Anderson.Andersons 18 wickets in the opening two matches have been central to England going 2-0 up in a three-match series ahead of this weeks third Test against Sri Lanka at Lords starting on Thursday.""Its a lovely accolade for our partnership that weve both managed to climb up the rankings like that,"" said Broad, who has now dropped down to third place in the standings.""Its great to have a little bit of competition, and we are both really competitive guys.""",06-07-2016,Broad has no problems playing against Mohammad Amir,cricket,LONDON,Ben Stokes;Stuart Broad;Anderson.Andersons;Chris;James Anderson.Andersons;Mohammad Asif;James;Mohammad Amir;Amir;Ben;Butt;Mohammad;Asif;Stokes;Stuart;Broad;Salman;Salman Butt,Broad;Mohammad Amir;Stuart Broad,Mitchell Starc;Amirs;Hardys

He has progressed well to date and has the potential to become one of the best around,"" former Chelsea manager Mourinho, who replaced Dutchman Louis van Gaal last month, said.""We look forward to working with him to help nurture that raw talent.""Bailly has 15 caps for Ivory Coast and was part of their 2015 Africa Cup of Nations-winning squad.He played 47 times for Villarreal after joining in 2015 from Espanyol, impressing in a back four that conceded only 35 goals in 38 La Liga matches last season and reached the Europa League semi-finals, losing to Liverpool.""I want to progress to be the best that I can be and I believe working with Jose Mourinho will help me develop in the right way and at the right club,"" said Bailly, who will likely partner England's Chris Smalling in central defence next season.The capture of Bailly marks the first of an expected flurry of signings by Mourinho as he seeks to restore the fortunes of the 20-times English champions who won the FA Cup last season but finished fifth in the Premier League.United, who will play in the Europa league after missing out on Champions League place, are also favourites to sign Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic while Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba has also been linked with a move to Old Trafford.",06-08-2016,Mourinho begins Man Utd rebuilding with signing of Bailly,football,,Zlatan;Jose Mourinho;Gaal;Eric Bailly;Eric;Chris Smalling;Paul Pogba;Paul;Zlatan Ibrahimovic;Jose;Louis van Gaal;Chris;van;Mourinho;Bailly;Smalling;Ibrahimovic;Pogba;Villarreal;Louis,Mourinho;Bailly;Jose Mourinho;Eric Bailly,Espanyol;Juventus;Liverpool;La Liga;United;Chelsea;Manchester United;Europa League
"Russian former world number one Maria Sharapova was handed a two-year ban by the International Tennis Federation on Wednesday following her positive test for banned drug meldonium at this year's Australian Open.In a statement the ITF said the 29-year-old five-times grand slam champion's ban would be back-dated to Jan. 26 this year, meaning her results from the Australian Open where she reached the quarter-finals, would be disqualified.""An Independent Tribunal appointed under Article 8.1 of the 2016 Tennis Anti-Doping Programme has found that Maria Sharapova committed an Anti-Doping Rule Violation under Article 2.1 of the Programme and as a consequence has disqualified the affected results and imposed a period of ineligibility of two years, commencing on 26 January 2016,"" the ITF said in a statement.Sharapova, the world's highest-paid female athlete, stunned the sporting world in March when she announced that she had tested positive for meldonium, a drug she said she had been taking for a decade to treat diabetes and low magnesium.Meldonium was added to the World Anti-Doping Agency's (WADA) list of banned substances at the start of the year after evidence that it boosted blood flow and enhanced athletic performance.After her admission, Swiss watchmaker TAG Heuer cut its ties with Sharapova while other brands such as Nike and Porsche distanced themselves from her.The ban means she will miss this year's Wimbledon championships, the title she won as a teenager to launch her career into orbit in 2004, and the Rio Olympics.At the time Sharapova, the highest-profile tennis player to fail an anti-doping test, insisted she had made ""a huge mistake"" blaming her failure to read an email sent by the ITF that meldonium had been added to the WADA list.Sharapova has 35 WTA singles titles and has won all four of the sport's grand slam titles.Her career earnings amount to $36 million while her off-court earnings, according to Forbes, are around $200 million.",06-08-2016,Sharapova banned for 2 years by ITF,tennis,,Maria Sharapova;Maria;Sharapova,Sharapova;Maria Sharapova,Forbes;WTA;World Anti-Doping Agency;WADA;Nike;Porsche;ITF;Independent Tribunal;Tennis Anti-Doping Programme
"LONDON: England have knack of coming unstuck as they chase a Test series whitewash but they will hope to complete the job against Sri Lanka at Lords this week -- despite clear signs of improvement from the tourists.England are 2-0 up with one Test to play, but the match starting on Thursday has more riding on it than it might appear for the hosts after recent series victories ended on a low note.Last year, having won the Ashes, England suffered an innings and 46-run defeat by Australia in the fifth Test at The Oval.There was a similarly heavy reverse in South Africa in January when, 2-0 up with one to play, England lost the fourth Test at Centurion by 280 runs.Although they won the second Test against Sri Lanka in Chester-le-Street by nine wickets, there were warning signs for England during that success.Sri Lanka, having become the first team since New Zealand in 1958 to be dismissed for under 120 in three successive Test innings, made 475 in the second knock in Durham -- including a fine hundred by Dinesh Chandimal.A typically good Lords pitch could make life harder still for fast bowlers in London, with the most even contest of the series so far in prospect.<br/> <br/> Englands two biggest doubts concern a pair of players who know Lords well as it is their Middlesex home ground.Top-order batsman Nick Compton has been struggling for runs, and fast bowler Steven Finn for wickets.With England having again selected a 12-man squad, it looks as if Compton will get another match at number three.Finns place is under threat from uncapped seamer Jake Ball, although England appear ready to retain the Middlesex quick.With England captain Alastair Cook now having completed the burdensome business of getting to 10,000 Test runs, the left-handed opener could be in the mood to make a major score at Lords.Meanwhile England new-ball duo James Anderson and Stuart Broad, first and third in the world Test bowler rankings respectively, will look to maintain their standing.Two years ago, Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews scored a fine Test century in a thrilling draw at Lords where the match went down to the last ball.For this fixture, Sri Lanka may make changes to their side.Stylish wicket-keeper/batsman Kusal Perera -- a late addition to the squad after his drugs ban was overturned by the International Cricket Council because of a faulty lab analysis in Doha -- could end more than six months out by replacing injured all-rounder Milinda Siriwardana (twisted ankle).Fast bowler Shaminda Eranga was reported for a suspect action during the second Test and is understood to have undergone tests at the England and Wales Cricket Boards training centre at Loughborough University this week.Although Eranga is still available to play, Sri Lanka could give a debut to uncapped 29-year-old left-armer Chaminda Bandara in the absence of the injured Dhammika Prasad and Dushmantha Chameera.",06-08-2016,England reach for the whitewash against Sri L,cricket,LONDON,Dinesh Chandimal.A;Ball;Mathews;Prasad;Finn;Shaminda;Dhammika Prasad;James Anderson;Bandara;Angelo;Cook;Alastair;Milinda Siriwardana;Angelo Mathews;Siriwardana;Jake;Nick Compton;Dhammika;Milinda;Alastair Cook;Compton;James;Nick;Eranga;Chaminda Bandara;Anderson;Steven Finn;Steven;Dinesh;Shaminda Eranga;Chandimal.A;Chaminda;Jake Ball,,Stuart Broad;International Cricket Council;Loughborough University
"LAHORE: Diana Baig, the talented 20-year-old girl plays for Pakistans national team in both cricket and football. She represented the country as one of the ""Girls in Green"" at the recent World Twenty20 tournament in India, in between practicing her penalty shoot-out skills.She grew up playing street cricket and football with other children in the magnificent Hunza Valley, their makeshift arenas ringed by some of the worlds tallest mountains in northern Gilgit-Baltistan.Baig belongs to the Ismaili sect of Shia Islam, which largely freed her from the restrictions placed on other more conservative women in the Muslim country, where her gender is battling for greater freedom.From the streets, Baig began playing in community events and for local teams, and by 2010 she was leading the newly-formed Gilgit-Baltistan womens team.Two years later, she was selected for Pakistans A side, and then as a reserve player for the 2013 World Cup. In 2015, she finally won her first international cap, playing for Pakistan against Bangladesh.Her journey to the forefront of Pakistani womens football was even more dramatic.While playing cricket in Islamabad in 2010, Baig tried out for the Gilgit-Baltistan football team on a whim after friends told her they needed players.She made the team and, to her disbelief, in 2014 was selected to play for Pakistan at the SAFF Championships in Bahrain.She has been a member of the starting 11 as a defender ever since, she says, unable to hide her excitement.Baig has had to fight harder for her cricket career.Unlike in mens cricket, Pakistans womens players are not contracted and are selected on a match by match basis from lower-ranked teams, such as the several hundred playing at the provincial level.That means that there were times when Baig was in -- and times when she was out.Now Baig is fighting to maintain a crucial balance between her sporting dreams and education.""It becomes very hard,"" she says. ""I try to start from football... I play football in the morning, then our cricket training starts around 11 or 12 noon and continues until 3:00 pm or 4:00 pm.""After that, she says, she heads to her university hostel for food and drink.

"LONDON: For someone who has spent six agonising months on the sidelines battling doping allegations, Sri Lankan Kusal Perera cannot think of a better place for his return than the hallowed turf of Lords in the third and final test against England on Thursday.The 25-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman was sent home from the tour of New Zealand in December after it was announced he had failed a drugs test last July.He was cleared last month when the International Cricket Council (ICC) dropped all charges against him after the Qatar-based laboratory that conducted the test withdrew its initial findings.Perera was not allowed to train with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) coaches and was called up in England only after a shoulder injury had ended paceman Dhammika Prasads tour.""I havent been told if Im playing yet but I was thrown into trouble and to come back from that at Lords would be a great opportunity,"" Kusal told reporters at Lords after practice on Tuesday.""I was banned just before a test, so to return in this format would be fitting.Even the time I was out of the team I knew I hadnt done anything wrong.But these things can happen in life.""Perera, who has played three tests and 51 one-dayers, admitted he arrived in England undercooked, having barely trained before a series he did not expect to be involved in.""I didnt have any time to think about whether I was in touch, or whether I could train, or even what was happening in cricket.""I started training the day after I was cleared.Before then I didnt do much batting -- just some fitness work.""Perera, however, felt he was fresh and striking the ball well, which might help his team salvage some pride after batting collapses in Leeds and Chester-le-Street helped the hosts open an unassailable 2-0 series lead.""I watched the attack and its mostly fast bowlers,"" he said of Englands bowlers.""In London, the conditions seem easier, because it must have been very cold in Durham.""When its cold you are a bit stiff and your feet dont work as well.With this weather and given the pitch as well -- which looks like it will be batting-friendly -- I think theres a chance for us to dominate them.""",06-08-2016,Sri Lankas Perera eyes Lords return doping ,cricket,LONDON,Kusal;Dhammika;Im;Kusal Perera;Prasads;Dhammika Prasads;Perera,Sri Lankas Perera,International Cricket Council;ICC;Chester-le-Street
"PASADENA, United States: Colombia became the first side to reach the quarter-finals of the Copa America Centenario on Tuesday, while the United States thumped Costa Rica 4-0 to get their campaign back on track.Goals from AC Milans Carlos Bacca and Real Madrid star James Rodriguez secured a 2-1 win for Colombia over Paraguay in front of a vocal crowd at the Pasadena Rose Bowl in California.Victor Ayala gave Paraguay hope after pulling a goal back on 71 minutes but Colombia held on for three points which means they are assured of a top two finish in Group A and a place in the last eight.Colombia need only to draw against Costa Rica on Saturday to assure themselves of first place, leaving them a potentially easier quarter-final against the runner-up from Group B, which contains Brazil, Ecuador, Haiti and Peru.In Tuesdays other game, US striker Clint Dempsey scored his 50th international goal as the host nation bounced back from their 2-0 loss to Colombia on Friday with a convincing rout of Costa Rica.Dempsey opened the scoring from the penalty spot after nine minutes before Jermaine Jones and Bobby Wood struck just before half-time to effectively settle the contest.Substitute Graham Zusi added a fourth goal three minutes from time, which could prove crucial if goal difference comes into play.The win came as a welcome relief for US coach Jurgen Klinsmann, whose tenure has faced mounting criticism over the past 18 months after a series of disappointing performances in competitive matches.On Wednesday, Peru could join Colombia in the quarter-finals if they manage to defeat Ecuador in Glendale, Arizona in Group B.In Wednesdays other game, five-time world champions Brazil face an intriguing matchup against Caribbean minnows Haiti in Orlando, Florida.",06-08-2016,Colombia into last eight US bounce back at Copa Ameri,football,PASADENA,Graham;James;Clint;Wood;Jurgen;Jurgen Klinsmann;Graham Zusi;Jermaine Jones;Carlos Bacca;Bacca;Jones;Dempsey;Bobby Wood;Jermaine;Klinsmann;Bobby;James Rodriguez;Zusi;Rodriguez;Carlos;Clint Dempsey,,Real Madrid;Copa America Centenario
"PROVIDENCE, GUYANA: South Africa roared back into contention in the Tri-Nation One-Day International series with a 47-run victory over Australia in the third match of the tournament at the Guyana National Stadium on Tuesday.Defending a modest 189 for nine on another pitch that challenged the patience and technique of all batsmen, the Proteas bowlers were resisted only by opener Aaron Finchs defiant 72 before he was ninth out as the World Cup-holders folded for 142 off 34.2 overs.By virtue of their margin of victory, South Africa also earned a bonus point and leapt from last to first on net run-rate over Australia, leaving hosts West Indies third.Competition resumes in St Kitts on Saturday with South Africa and Australia renewing their rivalry at Warner Park.Farhaan Behardiens workmanlike innings of 62 held South Africas innings together and earned him the ""Man of the Match"" award. However pacer Kagiso Rabada shared the plaudits with a useful unbeaten 15 as the tail contributed important runs and then led the way with the ball as he claimed three for 13 off seven probing overs.Rabada disposed of Usman Khawaja in his opening spell and returned to account for wicketkeeper-batsman Matthew Wade and tailender Nathan Coulter-Nile in an excellent display of controlled fast bowling. His effort was supported by Wayne Parnell, who shared the new ball and got rid of the dangerous David Warner in his very first over.Playing his first ODI for almost 16 months, Parnell then trapped Australian captain Steve Smith leg-before.Spinners Imran Tahir and Aaron Phangiso then tightened the stranglehold with two wickets apiece, while Tabraiz Shamsi, the left-arm leggie, marked his debut with the wicket of Glenn Maxwell in his first over to ensure there was no escape for the Aussies.""We started well with the two seamers although this wasnt the kind of surface where they were having the time of their lives,"" captain A.B. de Villiers said. ""(Tabraiz) Shamsi was a handful for their batters. I didnt see a lot of them picking him.""strong>- Tough games coming up -</strongEarlier, Australias fast bowling pair of Coulter-Nile and Josh Hazlewood proved most effective with two wickets each in restricting the Proteas after de Villiers surprisingly chose to bat first on winning the toss.""We didnt adapt well enough with the bat today,"" was Smiths assessment of his teams reply. ""Weve got a couple of tough games ahead of us now and we have to improve on this effort.""Coulter-Nile, who replaced Mitchell Starc from the opening victory over West Indies two days earlier, made the most of the opportunity with a spell of two for 38 off 10 overs.He claimed the vital wickets of de Villiers and J.P. Duminy in consecutive overs to reduce the South Africans to 104 for five midway through the innings, effectively killing off any realistic chance they had of posting a formidable total.Hazlewood was even more economical in conceding 20 runs off 10 metronomic overs. He earned an LBW verdict against Quinton de Kock to break the opening partnership with Hashim Amla and returned to get rid of Parnell.South Africa entertained hopes of a challenging total when de Villiers and Amla were at the crease. The two most experienced batsmen in the side put on 40 for the third wicket before Amla was run out for the third time in ODIs against Australia.Wickets continued to fall regularly thereafter and it was left to the lower-order players Phangiso and Rabada to assist Behardien in lifting the South Africans closer to the 200-run mark.",06-08-2016,S Africa back in business after ODI win over Australi,cricket,PROVIDENCE,de;Glenn Maxwell;Parnell;Maxwell;Wayne Parnell;Finchs;David Warner;Smith;Tabraiz Shamsi;Tahir;Phangiso;Wayne;Quinton;Aaron Phangiso;Kagiso;Matthew;David;Rabada;Behardien;Hashim;Hazlewood;Tabraiz;Usman;Wade;Imran Tahir;Quinton de Kock;Aaron Finchs;Usman Khawaja;Matthew Wade;A.B. de Villiers;Kock;Aaron;Warner;Nathan;Nathan Coulter-Nile;Kagiso Rabada;Josh;Steve Smith;Glenn;Amla;Hashim Amla;A.B.;Imran;Josh Hazlewood;Villiers;Steve;Khawaja;Shamsi;Coulter-Nile,,Mitchell Starc;Warner Park.Farhaan Behardiens;Parnell.South Africa;J.P.

"PHILADELPHIA: Uruguay were sent crashing out of the Copa America Centenario on Thursday as Venezuela and Mexico marched into the quarer-finals.Uruguay, the record 15-time Copa America champions, were eliminated in the group phase for the first time since 1997 after slumping to a shock 1-0 loss to Venezuela in Philadelphia.That result combined with Mexicos 2-0 Group C win over Jamaica in Pasadena left the 2011 champions struggling to digest a humiliating early exit.Uruguays defeat also capped a miserable tournament for Barcelona superstar Luis Suarez. Suarez, nursing a hamstring injury when he joined up with the squad, has so far not played a single minute.Suarez appeared in the dugout and looked visibly frustrated at his failure to get on the pitch, at one point appearing to punch the dugout wall.Venezuelas winner came on 36 minutes, when midfielder Alejandro Guerra cleverly spotted Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera off his line.Guerra unleashed a long-range effort from near the halfway line which the back-pedalling Muslera could only parry onto the bar before Salomon Rondon bundled in the rebound.Venezuelas advance to the last eight is the biggest shock of the tournament so far.<br/> The Venezuelans are currently bottom of South Americas 10-team round robin qualifying competition for the 2018 World Cup; Uruguay are on top of the standings. <br/> <br/> Venezuela will now face Mexico in their final first round game to determine who finishes top of Group C.Mexico, who had beaten Uruguay 3-1 in their opening game, meanwhile proved too powerful for Caribbean minnows Jamaica in front of an 83,263 crowd at the Pasadena Rose Bowl.With Californias large population of Mexican-Americans making it a virtual home game for El Tri, Mexico took the lead on 18 minutes when former Manchester United and Real Madrid striker Javier Hernandez nodded in his 45th international goal.Jamaica were denied what looked like a clear-cut penalty in the second half after striker Clayton Donaldson appeared to have been fouled in the area.The drama came in the 60th minute when Donaldson rounded his marker before being cut down by Yasser Corona. Replays showed the defender didnt get a touch on the ball.Jamaicas misery was sealed when Mexicos Hirving Lozano picked out Hector Herrera in the area and the midfielder nudged the ball on for substitute Oribe Peralta to stroke the ball first time inside the right hand upright on the 81st minute./> ",06-10-2016,Uruguay tumble out as Mexico Venezuela reach quarter,football,PHILADELPHIA,Herrera;Alejandro;El;Oribe;Hernandez;Tri;Yasser Corona;Fernando Muslera;Lozano;Rondon;Peralta;Salomon Rondon;Javier Hernandez;Donaldson;Yasser;Corona;Mexicos;Hector Herrera;Guerra;Luis Suarez;Javier;Oribe Peralta;Suarez;Salomon;Hector;Alejandro Guerra;Clayton;El Tri;Hirving;Luis;Mexicos Hirving Lozano;Fernando;Muslera;Clayton Donaldson,,Barcelona;Real Madrid;Manchester United;Mexicos 2-0 Group C
"Venezuela pulled off the shock of the Copa America so far by stunning Uruguay 1-0 to reach the quarter-finals, while Mexico also advanced with a 2-0 win over Jamaica.A goal by Salomon Rondon after 36 minutes in Philadelphia was enough to give Venezuela the points and eliminate the team that leads South American qualifying for the 2018 World Cup.Midfielder Alejandro 'Lobo' Guerra lobbed Fernando Muslera from more than 30 metres and although the Uruguayan goalkeeper got a finger tip to the ball, it bounced off the bar and fell to Rondon who tapped it into the net.""It was incredible what 'Lobo' did, the wit he had to hit it,"" Rondon said.""Luckily I had time to get there and finish.""The victory marked the first time Venezuela have notched two consecutive Copa America wins, while Rondon became the first Uruguay player to score in three Copa America tournaments.""I am surprised. The majority of my players did not have a good game,"" disappointed Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez told local radio.""The Uruguay that we are saw today are a long way from the Uruguay we saw play not that long ago.""Venezuela and Mexico, who each have six points in Group C, will meet next week to decide who will win the group, while Jamaica were also eliminated with Uruguay, the most successful Copa America nation.The Uruguayans, who won their 15th title in Argentina in 2011, pushed Venezuela back in the second half but lacked poise in front of goal and Muslera prevented them going further behind with a fine save from Adalberto Penaranda in the 68th minute.Edinson Cavani came close to equalising in the dying moments but was wide with one chance and had another saved by Dani Hernandez.There was to be no upset in the other match, however, with Mexico taking the lead after 17 minutes in Pasadena through Javier Chicharito Hernandez.The diminutive striker rose unmarked to pinpoint a glancing header into the bottom corner of the net after Jesus Corona had crossed from the left.Both sides had chances in an open and exciting game but Jamaica were let down by their finishing, particularly from Clayton Donaldson, who missed four clear-cut chances.At the other end, Jamaican keeper Andre Blake was in fine form and did well to keep the score down.Mexico were the better side, however, and Oribe Peralta, who came on for Hernandez after 77 minutes, scored just three minutes later after a quick break.The win was coach Juan Carlos Osorio's 10th consecutive victory since taking over last year.""We were convincing at all the right moments,"" goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa told reporters after the game.

"MARSEILLE: English and Russian soccer fans hurling bottles and chairs clashed with each other and French riot police in Marseille on Saturday ahead of their teams opening Euro 2016 match.There were also scuffles between visiting fans and locals in the narrow streets leading off Marseilles Vieux Port (Old Port), with some wielding cafe tables as weapons.Marseilles emergency services said one person suffered a heart attack during the fracas and had been taken to hospital while one middle-aged England fan was knocked unconscious.Water canon trucks moved in and dozens of police armed with batons cordoned off streets, firing tear gas to break up the skirmishes.""I hope they never reach the stadium,"" Sabine Bernasconi, a local mayor from Marseille, said.Tens of thousands of fans descended on Marseille ahead of the evenings match.Broken glass and debris littered some roads and walkways near the Queen Victoria pub, focal point of clashes between English, Russian and French fans on Thursday and Friday.The clouds of tear gas produced images of unrest all to similar, though on a much smaller scale, to those in the city 18 years ago when violence flared for two days and nights around Englands World Cup game against Tunisia.On Friday there were nine arrests and a handful of minor injuries as riot police, out in huge numbers, seemed content to corral the various factions to areas where they could control them and rarely intervened even when large groups were chasing each other around the town in the early hours.Pictures posted online showed Russian fans proudly displaying England flags captured during violent exchanges on Friday while groups of locals also weighed in, particularly with the throwing of bottles.The Queen Victoria and next-door Irish bar were forced to close their doors to England fans late last night, and several other bars in the Old Port area have said they will not be showing the England v Russia match on TV.With up to 90,000 fans expected to fill the city, authorities were endeavouring to keep some sort of control and the atmosphere around the stadium and on the route to the fan zones was convivial.There are designated separate routes to approach the Stade Velodrome for the match while the massive beach-side fan zone has been split into two sections, each holding 40,000, in an attempt at rough segregation.The games 9pm (1900 GMT) kickoff left time for a formidable amount of beer to be drunk and the authorities are braced for more disorder.",06-11-2016,Euro 2016 Clashes in Marseille ahead of England Russia ,football,MARSEILLE,Bernasconi;Victoria;Sabine;Sabine Bernasconi,,Marseille;Russia

Sri Lanka, bidding to avoid a whitewash at 2-0 down in this three-match series, resumed Saturday with Kaushal Silva 79 not out and Kusal Mendis 25 not.But they both fell for their overnight scores as Sri Lanka collapsed in overcast conditions that made batting harder than had been the case on Friday.<br/>Sri Lanka had not added a run when Woakes had Mendis lbw with his first ball Saturday to end a partnership of 54.It was just reward for the paceman, who saw Jonny Bairstow drop a simple catch off his bowling to reprieve Dimuth Karunaratne, eventually out for 50, on Friday.But wicket-keeper Bairstow, whose 167 not out on Friday was his Test-best score, made no mistake Saturday when he Silva edged Stuart Broad straight to him.Two years ago, Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews made a Test century at Lords. But the all-rounder was felled for three on Saturday, with 166 for three becoming 169 for four when he was squared up by Woakes and edged to Joe Root at second slip.Englands attack was far more accurate than it had been on Friday and Woakes, bowling at sharp pace, almost had a wicket next ball too only for Dinesh Chandimal to inside-edge a yorker that just missed the stumps for four.And 169 for four was transformed into 205 for six as under-pressure fast bowler Steven Finn took two wickets for three runs in 12 balls on his Middlesex home ground to set rid of second-Test century-maker Dinesh Chandimal (19) and Lahiru Thirimanne (17).Left-handers Kusal Perera (42) and Rangana Herath (31) fought back with a seventh-wicket stand of 71.

Last month he became, at 31 years and 157 days, the youngest player and first English batsman to reach the landmark of 10,000 Test runs.Both Shearer and Cook have already been honoured with the former receiving an Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2001 and the latter a Member of the British Empire (MBE) following his sterling performances in the Ashes victory over Australia in 2010/11.Cooks team-mate, former world number one ranked bowler Stuart Broad is also honoured with an MBE.The Queen made Saturday a double cause for celebration for Welsh rugby union refereeing great Nigel Owens as he receives an MBE.On Saturday he will become the record holder for refereeing Test matches as he takes charge of his 71st, the highly-charged Pacific Islands clash of Fiji v Tonga in the hot climes of Suva.Owens, 44, who refereed the Rugby World Cup final last year, paid tribute to the many people from the rugby world who had stood by him when he came out as a homosexual in 2007 -- a far cry from when as a younger man he contemplated suicide because he couldnt bring himself to tell his parents.Britains success in the Davis Cup last year was recognised with Andy Murrays older brother doubles specialist Jamie receiving an OBE as does the non-playing captain Leon Smith.Wiltshire, 42, lost 80% of her blood and was in a coma for 10 days after being caught up in the bomb at Aldgate tube station in 2005. Seven years later, she featured at the Paralympics in London.Other women to feature in the awards include Claire Williams, the deputy team principal of Formula 1 team Williams, who gets an OBE.Hayley Turner may have retired from the saddle but her feats as a female jockey have been noted by the Queen -- a noted enthusiast of the Turf -- as she gets a MBE.Turner more than mixed it with the likes of Frankie Dettori becoming the first woman to reach the landmark of 100 winners in a calendar year in 2008.",06-11-2016,Shearer and Cook head Queens sporting honour,cricket,LONDON,Andy Murrays;Cook;Frankie;Alastair;Claire;Murrays;Stuart Broad;Jamie;Williams;Alan Shearer;Wiltshire;Leon;Alastair Cook;Frankie Dettori;Alan;Leon Smith.Wiltshire;Martine;Claire Williams;Nigel Owens;Nigel;Owens;Elizabeth;Shearer;Stuart;Martine Wiltshire;Broad;Andy;Smith.Wiltshire;Dettori,Shearer;Cook;Alan Shearer;Alastair Cook,BBC

"FOXBOROUGH, United States: Arturo Vidal scored a controversial penalty deep into injury time as holders Chile snatched a dramatic 2-1 victory over Bolivia to keep their Copa America Centenario campaign alive here Friday.Bayern Munich star Vidal struck from the spot in the 10th minute of time added on after a hugely debatable penalty was awarded against Bolivian defender Luis Gutierrez for handball by US referee Jair Marrufo.Television replays showed Gutierrez had his right arm behind his back to avoid conceding a handball but Alexis Sanchezs cross struck him on the shoulder and Marrufo pointed to the spot after the apparent intervention of the linesman.Bolivias players surrounded the referee for angry protests but Marrufos decision stood and it was left to Vidal to drive home the penalty.The result gives Chile hope of reaching the last eight following their opening defeat to Argentina in Group D.Earlier a stunning 61st minute free-kick from Kuwait-based playmaker Jhasmani Campos appeared to have grabbed a share of the points for Bolivia at Gillette Stadium after Vidal had given Chile the lead just after half-time.Bolivia, beaten by Panama in their first match, have zero points from two games.After a scrappy first half, Chile looked to have taken a decisive breakthrough immediately after the restart with Vidals goal.Arsenal star Sanchez dispossessed Juan Carols Arce just outside the Bolivia area and fed Mauricio Pinilla.Pinilla looked up and squared for Vidal who swept in an emphatic finish to make it 1-0 on 46 minutes.Yet Bolivia got back on level terms after Chile conceded a free-kick from around 25 meters, slightly out to the right.There appeared to be little danger but Campos stepped up and produced a spectacular long-range strike which curled late before dipping into the top corner beyond the fingertips of Barcelona goalkeeper Claudio Bravo.",06-11-2016,Chile scrape Copa win after penalty shocker,handball,FOXBOROUGH,Pinilla.Pinilla;Luis Gutierrez;Mauricio;Marrufo.Television;Marrufo;Jair Marrufo.Television;Juan Carols Arce;Sanchezs;Marrufos;Campos;Gutierrez;Jair;Carols;Alexis;Claudio Bravo;Arturo;Arturo Vidal;Arce;Jhasmani Campos;Vidal;Jhasmani;Mauricio Pinilla.Pinilla;Luis;Claudio;Juan;Sanchez;Bravo;Alexis Sanchezs,,Vidals;Gillette Stadium;Barcelona;Copa America Centenario
"LONDON: Jonny Bairstow continued a brilliant year of run-scoring with a Test-best 167 not out against Sri Lanka at Lords on Friday.At stumps, Sri Lanka were 162 for one in reply to Englands first innings 416, a deficit of 254 runs.Kaushal Silva was 79 not out and Kusal Mendis unbeaten on 25 after left-handed opener Karunaratne made exactly 50.Considering the start of this series saw Sri Lanka become the first side since 1958 to be dismissed for under 120 in three successive Test innings, this was a fine effort.There had been signs of recovery in their last innings, where Sri Lanka made 475 in a nine-wicket defeat in the second Test, giving England an unassailable 2-0 lead in this three-match series.Karunaratne should have been out for 28 on Friday when he nicked all-rounder Chris Woakes, only for Bairstow to drop the two-handed waist-high chance.Karunaratne cashed in and after tea struck James Anderson, the worlds number one ranked Test bowler, for three fours in as many balls, including a well-hit drive.Yet having completed a 95-ball fifty, Karunaratne was dismissed when a leg glance was well caught by a diving Bairstow to give under-pressure fast bowler Steven Finn a wicket on his Middlesex home ground.Karunaratnes exit ended an opening stand of 108 with Silva -- easily Sri Lankas best top-order partnership of the series.Silva took Sri Lanka to 150 with a sublime drive through extra-cover for four off Stuart Broad.It wasnt until January that the 26-year-old Bairstow scored his first Test century.<br/> But since January 1 he has been in prolific batting form for both county champions Yorkshire and England, scoring 594 runs at an average of 118.8 in Tests and 1,127 runs in first-class cricket at 102.4.Friday saw Bairstow receive good support from Woakes (66) in a seventh-wicket partnership of 144.Meanwhile, Sri Lanka left-arm spinner Rangana Herath took an economical four for 81 in 36 overs.England resumed on 279 for six with Bairstow 107 not out and Woakes unbeaten on 23.Bairstows second century of the series, following his 140 on his Headingley home ground in the first Test, helped rescue England from the depths of 84 for four.Woakes was the initial aggressor on Friday and a boundary off Eranga saw him to a maiden Test fifty in 102 balls. But Woakes fell when caught and bowled by Herath off a chipped drive.Bairstow batted on and his leg-glanced four off Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews saw him surpass his previous Test-best 150 not out against South Africa at Cape Town in January.",06-11-2016,Sri Lanka hit back after Bairstow steers England to 416,cricket,LONDON,Jonny Bairstow;Mathews;Finn;Kusal;Chris Woakes;James Anderson;Angelo;Stuart Broad.It;Kusal Mendis;Rangana;Angelo Mathews;Broad.It;Chris;Herath;Bairstow;Silva;James;Eranga;Rangana Herath;Anderson;Steven Finn;Karunaratne;Woakes;Steven;Jonny;Stuart;Mendis,Bairstow;Jonny Bairstow,Middlesex;Yorkshire
"AUCKLAND: Former West Indies cricketer Franklyn Rose, who was deported from New Zealand earlier this year, has claimed the country is not safe for international cricketers ""especially if they are black"".Rose, who was the subject of a sex assault complaint while living in the country, told Television New Zealand on Saturday he was racially stereotyped by police.The sex assault investigation was eventually dropped with no charges laid and the 44-year-old was deported in April for overstaying his visa having spent his final weeks in prison.Rose, who played 19 Test matches for the West Indies between 1997-2000 and is now back in Jamaica, had been in New Zealand since 2011 on a work visa to play and coach in Auckland.""You cannot invite someone to your country to play and coach cricket, then throw him in jail for no reason, then kick him out of your country,"" he said.""What have I done to be locked in a prison cell for seven weeks? I felt so terrified and nervous when I realised I was living with and amongst serial killers, rapists and drug dealers.""Rose said he has written to the International Cricket Council stating ""New Zealand is not a safe place for international cricketers, especially if they are black"".He said he would have left New Zealand earlier had he not ended up in hospital after being assaulted in November 2012.While in hospital recovering from his wounds, Rose developed a blood clot in his lungs which prevented him from flying, he said, saying this was the reason he remained in the country for as long as he did.Police superintendent Bill Searle said police ""strongly refute"" Roses claim that the assault was not investigated properly, and that the investigating officer ""racially stereotyped"" him.""A full and thorough investigation was carried out into Mr. Roses reported assault,"" Searle said.""Mr. Roses version of events was not able to be corroborated. Mr. Rose was advised of the outcome of his case and thanked the investigating officer.""Searle said Rose never complained to the police about his treatment and he later ""extended an invitation to the investigating officer to bring other members of police to attend a promotional event at a bar"".Searle said now Rose had made the sex assault complaint public, he could confirm the cricketer ""was the subject of a police investigation earlier this year, in relation to sexual assault"".""No charges were laid.

"CHICAGO: Lionel Messi scored a magical hat-trick in 19 minutes as Argentina cruised into the Copa America Centenario quarter-finals with a 5-0 rout of Panama on Friday.Messi had been forced to delay his debut in the tournament after a slow recovery from a lower back injury, with Argentina coach Gerardo Martino surprisingly naming him amongst the substitutes once more.But Messi wasted no time in stamping his genius on the tournament after coming on in the 61st minute to replace Augusto Fernandez with Argentina leading the Group D game 1-0.An electrifying cameo from the Barcelona superstar began with his first goal of the tournament on 68 minutes, finishing with aplomb after Gonzalo Higuains shot bounced off a Panamanian defender into his path.But there was no question of luck with his second, with Messi curling a wonderful free-kick into the top corner to bring the Soldier Field crowd to its feet in the 78th minute.With Panamas heads down, Messi then duly completed his quick-fire hat-trick -- skipping clear of a marker inside the penalty area to finish emphatically for 4-0.There was still time for Messi to have a hand in Argentinas fifth goal of the evening, providing a sublime pass in the build-up to Sergio Agueros close range headed effort in the 90th minute.Agueros Manchester City team-mate Nicolas Otamendi had opened the scoring for Argentina in the seventh minute, heading home an Angel Di Maria free-kick from close range.The victory sees Argentina, convincing 2-1 winners over Chile in their opening game, guaranteed a spot in the last eight with one group game remaining.The only blemish on the evening was an injury to Angel Di Maria, who limped off in the first half to extend his miserable record of injuries in major tournaments.Argentina are now firmly on course to top Group D, with only one game against pointless Bolivia to come.Fridays win marked a dazzling return to the spotlight for Messi, who is determined to help lead Argentina to their first major international tournament victory for 23 years.Messi, a veteran of Argentinas agonizing defeats in the 2014 World Cup final and 2015 Copa America final, had arrived in the United States nursing a back injury sustained during a friendly victory against Honduras last month.He was late joining up with the squad after returning to Spain to give evidence in his tax fraud trial.",06-11-2016,Magical Messi grabs hat trick as Argentina romp into quarter,football,CHICAGO,Fernandez;Nicolas Otamendi;Nicolas;Lionel;Augusto;Gerardo;Higuains;Agueros;Otamendi;Gerardo Martino;Gonzalo;Lionel Messi;Angel Di Maria;Di;Gonzalo Higuains;Angel;Augusto Fernandez;Sergio;Sergio Agueros;Martino;Maria;Messi,Messi;Lionel Messi,

"Louisville: Muhammad Alis hometown Louisville on Friday said farewell to the boxing legend and civil rights hero, with thousands lining the streets for an emotional procession and thousands more packing a sports arena for a star-studded memorial service.The public ceremony, which began with a Quranic chant, capped two days of remembrance honoring the three-time heavyweight world champion known as ""The Greatest,"" who died last week at 74 after a long battle with Parkinsons disease.Former president Bill Clinton and comedian Billy Crystal were to eulogize the legendary fighter, after a funeral procession through Louisville, the largest city in the southern state of Kentucky where Ali was born at a time of racial segregation.Fans lining Louisvilles streets to catch a glimpse of the hearse carrying Alis remains were in a festive mood -- taking photos, cheering, applauding and chanting Alis name in the bright sunshine. Some even wore boxing gloves.The route covering about 18 miles (30 kilometers) passed by sites important to ""The Champ"": his childhood home, the Ali Center, the Center for African American Heritage -- which focuses on the lives of blacks in Kentucky -- and along Muhammad Ali Boulevard before arriving at the Cave Hill Cemetery for a heros burial.Spectators threw red roses and other flowers onto the hearse, blocking much of its windshield by the time it reached the cemetery. A fleet of limousines transporting Alis family and close friends followed in the cortege.Police officers jogged alongside the hearse as it passed Alis boyhood home, to keep the large crowd out of the street.""The kids love him, hes always stood for hope in this neighborhood,"" Toya Johnson, who wore an Ali T-shirt, told AFP.""For the youth here, he is an example.""Born Cassius Clay in 1942, the boxer won Olympic gold and went on to a glorious professional career, with his epic fights -- like the ""Rumble in the Jungle"" with George Foreman and the ""Thrilla in Manila"" with Joe Frazier -- now the stuff of sports legend.He shocked America by refusing to serve in Vietnam, a decision that cost him his title and his career for years.

"Croatia needed a touch of Luka Modric magic to beat Turkey 1-0 in their Euro 2016 Group D opener on Sunday, gaining a measure of revenge after their bitter quarter-final elimination by the same opponents at Euro 2008.Inspirational playmaker Modric put Croatia in front with a fine volley from 25 metres that bounced in front of diving Turkey goalkeeper Volkan Babacan shortly before halftime of a tense affair at Parc des Princes.The Real Madrid midfielder, who missed the opening penalty for Croatia in the 2008 shootout, made amends with an impressive display, organising his side with calm authority.A cloud of smoke after the goal suggested flares had been launched from a section of the stadium packed with Croatia fans. A smoke bomb was later thrown in behind the Croatia goal.No other incidents were reported in a game under tight scrutiny after the ugly scenes that marred Saturday's match between England and Russia in Marseille.Technically the better side, the Croatians, who had one foot in the last four eight years ago until they fell to Turkey on penalties, kept alive their hopes of surviving a tough group also featuring holders Spain and the Czech Republic, who face each other in Toulouse on Monday.Turkey, who had failed to qualify for a major tournament since their impressive Euro 2008 campaign, now face a struggle to reach the knockout stages.Turkey looked nervous in the opening stages and Croatia dictated the pace, with Modric, named man of the match, and Ivan Rakitic pulling the strings in midfield.The game was lively but with no clear chance for either side until Croatia midfielder Milan Badelj offered the first shot on target with a volley from 20 metres that failed to surprise Babacan.Seconds later, Turkey threatened for the first time with a header by Ozan Tufan from a fine Gokhan Gonul cross.The game became scrappy with quite a few fouls, notably from Turkey, and Croatia defender Vedran Corluka had to play most of the match with a bandaged, bleeding head after being elbowed by striker Cenk Tosun while fighting for a high ball.Croatia looked in command after the break and created a few opportunities, notably when captain Darijo Srna rattled the crossbar from a free kick after Rakitic was brought down outside the box.Playing a major tournament in France brings back sweet memories for Croatia, who lost in the semi-finals of the 1998 World Cup to host nation France before beating the Netherlands to finish third.",06-12-2016,Croatia gain some revenge on Turkey with Modric magi,football,Croatia,Babacan;Tosun;Tufan;Darijo Srna;Volkan;Gokhan Gonul;Darijo;Cenk Tosun;Ivan Rakitic;Milan Badelj;Srna;Ivan;Modric;Vedran Corluka;Luka;Rakitic;Ozan Tufan;Ozan;Cenk;Gonul;Corluka;Gokhan;Luka Modric;Milan;Vedran;Volkan Babacan;Badelj,,Parc des Princes.The Real Madrid

"LONDON: Nuwan Pradeep took three wickets and did some serious damage to a couple of England careers as Sri Lanka fought to avoid a series whitewash in the third Test at Lords on Saturday.England in their second innings were 109 for four at the close of the third day, a lead of 237 runs. Alex Hales was 41 not out, having been dropped on 19 and 39, with nightwatchman Steven Finn, missed on one, unbeaten on six.England, 2-0 up in the three-match series, were rocking at 50 for three before first-innings century-maker Jonny Bairstow helped Hales add 52 for the fourth wicket.However Pradeep had Nick Compton out for 19, caught behind tamely pushing at Shaminda Eranga.Compton had been promoted to open in place of England captain Alastair Cook, after the left-hander suffered a knee injury fielding close in earlier on Saturday.England were now 45 for one and that quickly became 50 for three. Joe Root (four) was bowled by an absolute shooter from Pradeep. New batsman James Vince was out for a golden duck as he deliberately played no shot to a Pradeep delivery that nipped back down the Lords slope and knocked over his off stump.Bairstow, in at 84 for four in the first innings before making a Test-best 167 not out, survived the hat-trick. But on 32 he too was clean bowled by Pradeep.Pradeep ended the day with three for 25 in nine overs but his figures could easily have been better.Earlier, England all-rounder Chris Woakes started and finished a collapse that saw Sri Lanka, 162 for one overnight, dismissed for 288. That gave England, who made 416 in their first innings, a lead of 128.Woakes, who took a wicket with his first ball Saturday, ended the innings with the opening delivery of a new spell when Eranga was caught in the slips.<br/> Warwickshire all-rounder Woakes took three for 31 in 17.1 overs.Sri Lanka resumed Saturday with Kaushal Silva 79 not out and Kusal Mendis 25 not. But they both fell for their overnight scores as Sri Lanka subsided in the face of increasingly accurate fast bowling, with the overcast conditions making batting harder than had been the case on Friday.Woakes had Mendis lbw with his first ball Saturday before Silva was caught behind off Stuart Broad.Kusal Perera (42) and Rangana Herath (31) checked Englands progress with a seventh-wicket partnership of 71.Pereras bold innings was particularly impressive as this was his first match in more than six months after a drugs ban was rescinded because of a botched analysis. He was eventually caught behind after wildly slogging at James Anderson to start a slump that saw Sri Lanka lose all their last three wickets on 288.",06-12-2016,Pradeep treble rocks England in third T,cricket,LONDON,Jonny Bairstow;Rangana;Stuart Broad.Kusal Perera;Chris;Nuwan;Alex;Joe;Herath;Bairstow;Silva;Compton;Root;Nuwan Pradeep;Nick;Eranga;Joe Root;Steven;Mendis;Finn;Chris Woakes;Kusal;James Anderson;Hales;Cook;Alastair;Kusal Mendis;Nick Compton;Kaushal Silva;Alastair Cook;Kaushal;James;Broad.Kusal;Pradeep;Rangana Herath;Anderson;Steven Finn;Woakes;Vince;Jonny;Stuart;Alex Hales;James Vince;Perera,Pradeep;Nuwan Pradeep,Pradeep.Pradeep;Shaminda Eranga.Compton;Warwickshire
"St. Kitts: Opening batsman David Warner made his first one-day international (ODI) century outside Australia to set his team on their way to a 36-run victory over South Africa in the fourth match of a triangular ODI series on Saturday.After Australia made a respectable 288 for six off their allotted 50 overs, South Africa looked to be cruising to victory for much of their innings at Warner Park in Basseterre, on the Caribbean island of St Kitts.However, a persistent Australian bowling attack finally took its toll and South Africa collapsed from 210/3 in the 38th over to lose their final seven wickets for only 42 runs and were all out for 252 off 47.4 overs.Warner made 109 from 157 balls on a pitch that, initially at least, was far more conducive to runs than the slow, low surface that hosted the first three games of the series in Guyana.It was his sixth ODI century, with his previous five coming on home soil.<br/> He later injured a finger diving for a catch and left the field for treatment.The result leaves Australia with two wins from three matches, while South Africa has one win from three.West Indies have one win from two matches, ahead of their game against Australia in St. Kitts on Monday.Fast bowlers Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood and spinner Adam Zampa took three wickets each for Australia.Hazlewood picked up the prized wicket of South African captain AB de Villiers (39) with a superb delivery that swung late, beat the inside edge and collected middle stump.It proved to be the turning point of the match as de Villiers departed to leave South Africa 210/4, after which it all went awry for the Proteas.",06-12-2016,Warner ton helps Australia beat South Africa by 36 ru,cricket,St. Kitts,de;Josh Hazlewood;Adam;de Villiers;Warner;Adam Zampa;Villiers;Zampa;David;Josh;Hazlewood;David Warner,,Mitchell Starc;Warner Park

"Spain are steadily turning to the next generation ahead of their Euro 2016 opener against the Czech Republic later on Monday as the defending champions look to redeem themselves after a miserable World Cup two years ago.For Spain's disappointing showing in 2014, coach Vicente del Bosque retained 16 of the squad that won the title in 2010, but only eight winners remain for Euro 2016, with players such as Alvaro Morata, Hector Bellerin and Thiago Alcantara introduced as part of a significant changing of the guard.Sergio Ramos is confident the new boys, five of whom were part of the 2013 European under 21-winning side, can lead Spain into a new golden era.""People got used to us winning,"" he told reporters on Sunday, ""and maybe we did too, we didn't value our achievements.""This team can shine at the same level as before, or almost as much.

"Germany may have won their opening Euro 2016 game against Ukraine 2-0 on Sunday, with talismanic captain Bastian Schweinsteiger scoring late, but the victory also highlighted the need for defensive repairs.The world champions looked to be heading in the right direction when defender Shkodran Mustafi, starting in place of the injured Mats Hummels, headed them into the lead from a free kick, something they had worked on in the run-up to the tournament.However, instead of sitting back and relaxing, Germany coach Joachim Loew had to wait until stoppage time for his team to secure victory when Schweinsteiger netted just minutes after coming on as a substitute.Group C rivals Ukraine sliced open Loew's makeshift rearguard time and again in the first half with Mustafi and Jerome Boateng failing to work well together.Boateng did produce a spectacular goalline clearance but full backs Jonas Hector and Benedikt Hoewedes also struggled to contain the speed of wingers Andriy Yarmolenko and Yevhen Konoplyanka.The German defence was always going to be problematic with Hoewedes and Boateng only recently back from long injury absences.Hummels, Boateng's partner in the middle during their 2014 World Cup triumph in Brazil, is temporarily sidelined while fellow centre back Antonio Ruediger was ruled out of the Euros with torn knee ligaments.Ukraine were unable to sustain the same tempo after the break but their display showed Germany they will need to raise their game against Poland on Thursday.strong>BETTER ORGANISED</strong""We had to make adjustments in defence,"" said Loew.

"LONDON: Sri Lanka Cricket will lodge a complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC) against an ""unacceptable"" reprieve for England batsman Alex Hales in the third and final test at Lord's, SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala has said.Nuwan Pradeep clean bowled Hales, then on 58, in England's second innings on Sunday but it was adjudged a no-ball by umpire Rod Tucker, even though replays suggested a fraction of the paceman's shoe was behind the popping crease.Hales capitalised on the reprieve to score 94 before he was finally dismissed but his reprieve prompted the visitors to briefly unfurl a Sri Lankan flag from the balcony in a perceived mark of protest.""The management on tour is very sad about that decision and it will be reported to the ICC,"" Sumathipala, who termed it ""unacceptable"", said.Coach Graham Ford, who complained to match referee Andy Pycroft after Sunday's play, played down the unfurling of the flag by the team, who have already surrendered the three-test series after crushing defeats in Leeds and Durham.The SLC chief, however, saw it differently.""The flag is a symbol,"" Sumathipala said. ""It is a mark to say we are not happy with the decision. (It was unfurled) To show solidarity and fight back.""Ford said Tucker had apologised for the mistake and the coach was of the view that front-foot no-ball calls should be taken out of the on-field umpire's hand.""It just seems strange that with the technology that is available you can get a line call wrong,"" Ford said.""You'd think the best solution would be for the umpires to worry about what's going on down the other end and for technology to look after the line call.""Meanwhile, England paceman James Anderson was reprimanded for ""conduct that is contrary to the spirit of the game"" during the match, the ICC said in a statement.Anderson was guilty of showing disrespect to umpire S Ravi, who had asked the paceman not to verbally engage with Sri Lankan batsman Rangana Herath during the visitors' first innings.Sri Lanka resume Monday's final day on 32 for no loss, needing 330 more runs to salvage some pride in the series in which they have been thoroughly outplayed.",6/13/2016,Angry Sri Lanka complain against England Hales repriev,cricket,LONDON,Tucker;Graham;Thilanga Sumathipala;Andy Pycroft;James Anderson;Hales;Thilanga;Rangana;S;Alex;Herath;James;S Ravi;Ravi;Rod;Rod Tucker;Pradeep;Rangana Herath;Anderson;Pycroft;Graham Ford;Sumathipala;Alex Hales;Ford;Andy,,International Cricket Council;ICC;Ford;SLC

"Stand-in centre back Shkodran Mustafi headed his first goal for Germany and Bastian Schweinsteiger scored in stoppage time as the world champions survived several scares to beat Ukraine 2-0 in their opening Euro 2016 Group C match on Sunday.Mustafi, who started in the absence of regular centre back Mats Hummels, rifled home a header after 19 minutes to give Germany the lead, which was not extended until Schweinsteiger, a 90th-minute substitute, swept home from close range.Germany, bidding for a fourth Euro triumph but first since 1996, dominated possession, but also relied on three top saves from keeper Manuel Neuer and a goal-line clearance by Jerome Boateng to come out on top.Ukraine, playing in their second European championship, harried and hustled their opponents and their tight defence offered few clear sights of goal to the Germans.Yet lone striker Roman Zozulya was unable to offer much threat, except at the very start and in the closing stages as Ukraine pushed on in search of an equaliser.In a breakneck first half, Ukraine's Yevhen Konoplyanka forced Germany keeper Neuer to make a flying save in the fourth minute before the Germans steadily took control, with Toni Kroos orchestrating most of their attacks.It was from his free kick, that Mustafi, who last featured for Germany in March and only made the side because Hummels was recovering from a muscle injury, leapt behind Serhiy Sydorchuk to power in a header.Ten minutes later Sami Khedira had the chance to double Germany's lead as Kroos floated a ball beyond the defence, but he shot straight at the keeper.By then though, the Ukrainians had woken up and, driving their full backs higher up the pitch, forced Neuer to punch over a strong header from Yevhen Khacheridi.Boateng was then forced into a dramatic clearance, having first lost the ball before hacking it clear while back-pedalling into the net. Lone striker Zozulya also had an effort disallowed for offside as Germany hung on until halftime.Ukraine posed less of a threat in the second half, relying on hopeful long balls forward, while their keeper Andriy Pyatov was forced into action to save a long-range effort from Khedira, a low drive from Thomas Mueller and from Mesut Ozil, when he was through on goal.Germany suffered one final fright when Mustafi headed back over Neuer's head, leaving the goalkeeper to scramble back towards his own net, while appearing to body check substitute striker Yevhen Seleznyov in the process.Then, in the final seconds, with Ukraine pushing up, Germany countered and Schweinsteiger slammed in an Ozil cross to score.The result extended Germany's unbeaten run against Ukraine to six matches and maintained their record of never having lost their opening match in a European Championship.Germany will play joint group leaders Poland at the Stade de France on Thursday, when Ukraine take on Northern Ireland in Lyon.Several hours before the match, German and Ukrainian supporters scuffled briefly in the centre of Lille, though police quickly brought the situation under control.",6/13/2016,Stand in Mustafi helps Germany to nervy win over Ukrai,football,,Sami Khedira;Jerome Boateng;Yevhen Khacheridi.Boateng;Thomas Mueller;Manuel;Seleznyov;Manuel Neuer;Yevhen Konoplyanka;Serhiy Sydorchuk;Yevhen;Andriy;Boateng;Sami;Bastian Schweinsteiger;Toni;Khacheridi.Boateng;Bastian;Yevhen Seleznyov;Serhiy;Shkodran;Toni Kroos;Ozil;Shkodran Mustafi;Sydorchuk;Neuer;Khedira;Pyatov;Schweinsteiger;Thomas;Mueller;Konoplyanka;Mesut Ozil;Roman Zozulya;Mustafi;Roman;Zozulya;Mesut;Kroos;Jerome;Andriy Pyatov,,
"LONDON: Sri Lanka coach Graham Ford called for all no-ball decisions to be taken by the third umpire as his side reacted to an incorrect call in the third Test against England with an extraordinary flag protest at Lords on Sunday.At stumps, Sri Lanka were 32 without loss in their second innings, needing a further 330 runs on Mondays fifth and final day to reach an imposing victory target of 362.More realistically, their goal was to prevent England, already 2-0 up in the three-match series, taking the 10 wickets they needed to complete a whitewash.But England captain Alastair Cook, 49 not out batting down the order after a knee injury suffered while fielding, may not have been able to declare his sides second innings on 233 for seven had a few close calls Sunday gone Sri Lankas way instead.Significantly, Sri Lanka thought they had Alex Hales -- who went on to make 94 -- out for 58 when he was bowled by Nuwan Pradeep. But Australian umpire Rod Tucker had already called a no-ball. Replays suggested Pradeeps front foot may have been behind the crease but fielding teams are unable to challenge a no-ball call by an umpire and Hales survived.In February, a similar incident saw Australias Adam Voges make 239 in a Test against New Zealand in Wellington after being reprieved on seven following an incorrectly called no-ball by English umpire Richard Illingworth.Under International Cricket Council regulations, the third umpire is powerless to intervene in such situations.There are proposals on the table to prevent a repeat of these types of incidents and Ford said: ""The ICC have to look at it.""It seems strange with the technology available that you can still get a line call wrong,"" the South African added.""The best solution is for the umpires to worry about whats happening down the other end and let technology look after the line call. ""The game has a funny way of kicking you when you are down. That was a kick we didnt need.""The Sri Lanka management reacted to Haless reprieve by draping the national over the tourists dressing-room balcony for some 45 minutes.Ford said this wasnt so much a protest as a gesture of solidarity with the players out on the middle.""At that stage we felt the boys were fighting hard and we wanted to show our support from the dressing room to boost their morale --only for us to find out thats not the done thing and we had to take it down,"" said Ford.He added that Tucker had apologised to Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews for his mistake.""He got the news from the third umpire and he apologised to Angelo. It was very good of him to have done that and we move on.""Hales, for all his good fortune Sunday, was still left waiting for a maiden Test hundred.The Nottinghamshire opener, out for 86 and 83 in the first two Tests, got closer still on Sunday before he was lbw to medium-pacer Mathews.Somewhat ironically, in view of Sri Lankas earlier protest, Hales sought a review of the decision only for DRS to find in the tourists favour on this occasion.""Its disappointing again to come so close,"" said Hales, whose 126-ball innings included 10 fours and a six.""But it was pretty decent delivery and I had my fair share of luck -- bowled off a no-ball, umpires calls and edges -- I guess the luck ran out.""",6/13/2016,Flag protest fires up Sri Lanka in Lords no ball r,cricket,LONDON,Tucker;Mathews;Graham;Hales;Angelo;Cook;Alastair;Angelo Mathews;Richard;Alastair Cook;Nuwan;Alex;Nuwan Pradeep;Rod;Rod Tucker;Australias Adam Voges;Pradeep;Australias;Adam;Voges;Graham Ford;Alex Hales;Ford,,Illingworth.Under International Cricket Council;Nottinghamshire;ICC;Ford

"ISTANBUL: Turkeys young midfielder Ozan Tufan was Tuesday targeted by mockery at home and abroad after pictures showed him smoothly adjusting his hair at the very moment Croatias Luka Modric scored a stunning match-winning volley in Euro 2016.Tufan, 21, was scapegoated by many fans for Turkeys disappointing 1-0 defeat by Croatia over the weekend, which left the team with a mountain to climb to make it out of the group stages at the tournament in France.The Fenerbahce player was seen jogging languidly out of the penalty area and running his hands through his locks when Modric clattered the stunning volley over Tufans head.The player was oblivious to what happened until he looked round to see the ball in the Turkish net. Furious Turkish fans on Twitter posted pictures showing Tufan as a model in a shampoo commercial or as a crooner on a 1970s record cover with the fashionable curly locks of the time.""While Modric lets rip Tufan is in the middle of a hair commercial,"" fumed one Twitter user. The incident has played into the fears of many Turkish fans that their stars, who enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame and fortune, lack the sheer hunger and toughness for the big stage.Turkish fans also shared a viral cartoon of Tufan by caricaturist Omar Momani showing the player admiring himself in the mirror with a hair-dryer stuffed down his shorts as Modric strikes the winning goal.However with much of the vitriol on Twitter coming from fans of his clubs arch rivals Galatasaray, the chairman of Fenerbahce rallied behind the player.""After the match, I saw that many newspapers were putting all the blame on the back of Ozan,"" Aziz Yildirim was quoted as saying by the Hurriyet daily.""The boy is just 21 years old and represents the future of Turkish football.

"LONDON:c said he was looking forward to the challenge of facing Pakistan following his sides commanding Test series win over Sri Lanka.Rain meant only 12.2 overs were possible at Lords on Monday as the third Test ended in a draw.But although denied a whitewash, England had already done enough to secure a 2-0 series win after dominant victories by an innings and 88 runs and nine wickets over the Lankans at Leeds and Chester-le-Street respectively.England now hold Test series trophies against every other major international side except Pakistan, who beat Cooks men 2-1 in a three-match series in the United Arab Emirates in November last year.However, they will have a chance to put that right when they face Pakistan in a four-Test series starting at Lords on July 14.""Theyve got a very good (pace) attack, backed up with spinners,"" Cook said of Pakistan. ""Were ready for them. We scored a lot of runs against Australias attack here last year -- I think its going to be a brilliant series.""While Test specialist Cook prepares for Pakistan, wicket-keeper Jonny Bairstow will be looking to take his red-ball form into the intervening five one-day internationals against Sri Lanka.Bairstows recall into Englands one-day squad was announced just as he was being confirmed as both man-of-the-match at Lords and the hosts overall man of the Test series too.His 167 not out in the first innings at Lords was his Test-best score and came amidst a series scoring-spree that saw Bairstow total 387 runs at an average of 129, with the Yorkshireman also holding 19 catches behind the stumps.Together with James Anderson, who took 21 wickets at a stunningly low average of 10.80, Bairstow was the central figure of the series.Bairstow repeatedly helped England recover from top-order collapses against Sri Lanka and Cook likened his contribution to that of retired former England wicket-keeper Matt Prior.Priors wicket-keeping came under intense scrutiny early in his career, especially as England -- be it Alan Knott, Bob Taylor or Jack Russell -- have long prided themselves on their glovemen.Bairstow, himself the son of the late former Yorkshire and England wicket-keeper David Bairstow, also found his work in the field being called into question after he floored a couple of seemingly straightforward chances against Sri Lanka.Bairstow, meanwhile, was pleased at maintaining the form he showed in South Africa, where his 150 not out in Cape Town in January gave him a maiden Test century.For Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews, the hope is his side, having had time to adjust to English conditions, will raise their game in the white-ball formats.<br/> However, the all-rounder accepted England were a much improved one-day team from the side that Sri Lanka thrashed by nine wickets at last years World Cup in Wellington.",6/14/2016,Cook ready for Pakistan after Sri Lanka su,cricket,LONDON,Jonny Bairstow;Mathews;James Anderson;Angelo;Cook;Matt;Angelo Mathews;Bob Taylor;Bob;Alan Knott;Knott;Jack;Bairstow;James;Taylor;Alan;Anderson;Jonny;Russell;David Bairstow;David;Jack Russell,Cook,Cooks

"Ireland can take encouragement from a 1-1 draw in their Euro 2016 Group E opener on Monday but the result was a cause of great concern for Sweden whose mediocrity contrasted starkly with their opponents' desire.Ireland were the better team and Sweden were fortunate to grab an equaliser when Irish defender Ciaran Clark headed a cross into his own goal after Wes Hoolahan had opened the scoring with a splendid strike early in the second half.It was another misfortune for Ireland at the Stade de France, where they were playing for the first time since Thierry Henry's infamous handball for France led to a goal that crushed the 2010 World Cup qualifying dreams of the Irish in a playoff.Monday's match was probably the one the Irish and Swedes had targeted for a win in a section that also features traditional European force Italy and a talented Belgium side.Martin O'Neill's Boys in Green, however, can be more optimistic than Erik Hamren's Blue-Yellows, who did not manage a single shot on target despite the efforts of talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who was kept fairly quiet by Ireland's defence.""We have two very, very tough matches coming against two sides that are very classy,"" said O'Neill.""But if I can take anything from the performance today, it was that the players looked accomplished. We have the desire but the players are growing into international football.""Both teams were backed by hordes of fans and the yellow and green armies brought a festive touch to the Stade de France, in sharp contrast with the violence that has marred the tournament.O'Neill's side showed a real desire to win, making two attacking substitutions after Sweden's equaliser, while the Scandinavians looked slow and toothless until Ireland took a deserved lead three minutes after the break.Hoolahan struck a superb half-volley into the net from Seamus Coleman's perfect cross into the area triggering a roar rarely heard in the usually subdued Stade de France.strong>MATCH-WINNING CHANCE</strongThat acted as a wake-up call for Sweden, who were relying on their enigmatic 34-year-old captain Ibrahimovic.""I came like a king, left like a legend,"" Ibrahimovic quipped as he left Paris St Germain at the end of last season after helping them win a second straight domestic treble.He was certainly neither when he returned to Paris on Monday.In the first half, Ibrahimovic looked lost on a pitch where which he won two French Cup and two League Cup trophies and, while he produced the cross that led to Ireland's own goal, the striker failed to convert a chance in the closing stages.In the 71st minute, Ibrahimovic made a rare break down the left flank into the area and his cross was headed into his own goal by the unfortunate Clark.Twelve minutes later, however, Ibrahimovic just failed to connect as Martin Olsson's cross whizzed in front of him, missing the chance to score an almost certain winner albeit undeserved.""The feeling right now is disappointment rather than coming back for a draw,"" said Hamren.""For the first 50 minutes Ireland were better. Credit to Ireland. Our attack was really bad in the first half. They were able to close us down.We didnt lose but Im disappointed because we didnt play the way we should have done.""Ibrahimovic added: ""I tried but I can do much better,""",6/14/2016,Ireland can build on draw after Sweden disappoi,football,Ireland,Hamren;Zlatan;Wes Hoolahan;Wes;Neill;Martin Olsson;Olsson;Erik Hamren;Erik;Zlatan Ibrahimovic;Clark;Seamus Coleman;Henry;Ciaran Clark;Thierry Henry;Seamus;Hoolahan;O'Neill;Martin;Ibrahimovic;Ciaran;Thierry;Coleman,,Paris St Germain
"Basseterre, Saint Kitts and Nevis: Marlon Samuels produced his best batting effort in One-Day International cricket against Australia to lead the West Indies to a six-wicket victory in the fifth match of the Tri-Nation series at Warner Park in St Kitts on Monday.Set a challenging target after Usman Khawajas 98 and supporting half-centuries from skipper Steve Smith (74) and George Bailey (55) lifted the visitors to 265 for seven batting first, the enigmatic Samuels stroked 92 to ensure that the target was reached with 20 deliveries to spare.The Jamaican right-hander made an important deposit on a significant overdraft against the World Cup-holders, his innings spanning 87 deliveries and decorated with eight fours and four sixes -- the last three of which came off consecutive balls from leg-spinner Adam Zampa over long-off.In keeping with his mercurial nature, he was run out off the very next delivery to have the West Indies at 240 for four in the 41st over. Two more wickets fell to Nathan Coulter-Nile with the score at 254 before Kieron Pollard and Carlos Brathwaite formalised victory in the 46th over.Denesh Ramdin also played a key role in the run-chase. He supported Samuels in a 73-run fourth-wicket stand and continued to play sensibly following the demise of his senior partner before being bowled by Coulter-Nile for 29.Victory pulled the West Indies within a point of leaders Australia in the three-team standings. West Indies next play South Africa on Wednesday at the same venue.Samuels had joined Darren Bravo at the crease following a rollicking opening stand of 74 in ten overs before all-rounder James Faulker removed Fletcher for 27 while Zampa trapped Charles in front for 48.Bravo and Samuels then steadied the West Indies chase, keeping them well on course in an 82-run third-wicket partnership that was broken when Zampa removed Bravo for 39 via at bat-pad catch that lobbed comfortably to wicketkeeper Matthew Wade.Earlier, Khawajas promotion to open the batting in the absence of the injured David Warner paid immediate dividends.He lost Aaron Finch in the very first over to West Indies captain Jason Holder but then featured in a 170-run second-wicket partnership with Smith, who overcame the nagging discomfort of a right leg injury to help put his team in a commanding position by the time he departed in the 35th over, the victim of a clever change of pace from all-rounder Carlos Brathwaite.Khawaja was on the verge of a maiden ODI hundred but, becalmed in the nineties, he took on the challenge of a third run for his third-wicket partner, Bailey, and was found short of his ground by Jerome Taylors return from the boundary to stand-in wicketkeeper Fletcher. His innings occupied 123 deliveries and was embellished by three sixes and four fours.Fletchers position behind the stumps was the result of an injury to Ramdin who fell heavily on his right shoulder when attempting to effect a run out a few overs earlier. He returned for the final overs, taking two catches to dismiss Travis Head and Bailey off Pollard.Head earned his selection after Warner was ruled out of the rest of the tournament with a broken finger sustained against South Africa on Saturday.

"LONDON: Rain ensured England and Sri Lanka drew the third Test at Lords on Monday, a result that saw England win the three-match series 2-0.Sri Lanka set 362 to win, finished on 78 for one after rain, which had prevented any play before lunch on the final day, finally saw the umpires abandon the match as a draw at 5:12 pm local time (1612 GMT).Dimuth Karunaratne was 37 not out and Kusal Mendis 17 not out.Mondays result left Sri Lanka still searching for their first Test win at Lords, having now drawn six and lost two of their longest-format clashes at the home of cricket.Only 22 balls were possible between lunch and tea after rain washed out Mondays first session, but that was long enough for Sri Lanka to lose opener Kaushal Silva.Sri Lanka resumed Monday on 32 without loss. Karunaratne was 19 not out and Silva unbeaten on 12.Mondays first over saw Silva edge Broad just short of England captain Alastair Cook at first slip. But Anderson, Englands all-time leading Test-wicket taker, struck when Silva, padding up after failing to pick an inswinger going against the Lords slipe, was lbw for 16.Silva reviewed but to no avail, with Sri Lanka 45 for one. No sooner had Silva been dismissed than the umpires took the players off the field after just 18 minutes play. But the weather relented for play to resume after tea. Even though the floodlights were on, there was now a risk the match might be halted for bad light.Bairstows Test-best 167 not out and 85 from Cook were the major contributions to Englands first innings 416. Sri Lanka could only manage 288 in reply, despite fifties from Karunaratne and Silva.Englands second innings 233 for seven declared saw Alex Hales again fall short of a maiden Test century with 94 -- his third fifty of a series where the opener had twice been dismissed in the 80s.Sri Lanka continue their tour with two one-day internationals against Ireland in Dublin on Thursday and Saturday. They then face England in the first at Nottinghams Trent Bridge in the first of five one-dayers on June 21.Mondays draw meant England lead the inaugural Super Series against Sri Lanka by 10 points to two.

"Soccer rivalry and fan violence spilled into global politics as Moscow summoned the French ambassador over detentions of Russians at Euro 2016 and warned an ""anti-Russian"" mood could even damage relations between Russia and France.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused other countries' football fans of ""absolutely provocative actions"" at the tournament, such as trampling on the Russian flag.Police used pepper spray and tear gas to disperse English soccer fans on Wednesday near the train station in the northern city of Lille, a police source said.They intervened after fans starting running in all directions following a detonation of unknown origin, the source told Reuters. Earlier, police pushed away a group of English fans when they became ""threatening"".Authorities had flooded the city with police ahead of the next matches for Russia and England in the soccer tournament.Four Russian fans were arrested in Lille and were to be deported after being detained before Wednesday's game between Russia and Slovakia, which the Russians lost 2-1.""Two of the Russians were arrested yesterday evening during a fight in Lille and two after being found drunk in a car with weapons,"" a spokesperson at the Lille prefecture said.

"BORDEAUX: Adam Szalai and Zoltan Stieber scored second-half goals as Hungary stunned highly-fancied Austria 2-0 in their Group F opener in Bordeaux on Tuesday (Jun 14).Austria, tipped as tournament dark horses, dominated the opening period but Szalai fired Hungary ahead on 62 minutes with Stieber wrapping up a shock victory over their old rivals late on in the 138th meeting between the sides.Aleksandar Dragovic was sent off for Austria shortly after Szalai ended an 18-month goal drought as Hungary made a triumphant return to a major tournament having last featured at the 1986 World Cup.Hungary goalkeeper Gabor Kiraly kept a clean sheet as he became the first 40-year-old to feature at the European Championship, surpassing Germany's Lothar Matthaus as the oldest player in tournament history.Austria captain Christian Fuchs and winger Martin Harnik were the only two survivors from the country's debut campaign eight years ago named in Marcel Koller's starting line-up.However, they were inches away from the perfect start when Bayern Munich star David Alaba went agonisingly close to justifying his billing as one of the potential stars of the tournament when his dipping left-footed strike from outside the area crashed against the post.The versatile Alaba, operating in his customary central midfield with Austria, soon fired another warning to Hungary with a first-time strike at Kiraly after a threaded pass through from Marko Arnautovic.Szalai miscued a header from a Balazs Dzsudzsak free-kick in a rare opening for Hungary, while Kiraly showed his reflexes remain sharp despite his advancing years to claw behind a low strike from Zlatko Junuzovic.Arnautovic then slid a dangerous low ball across the face of goal as Austria continued to threaten, but Harnik lost his footing as he tried to slide home at the far post.Hungary captain Dzsudzsak wasted arguably the best chance of the opening 45 minutes, though, as he screwed his shot wide of goal after he was picked out by Laszlo Kleinheisler on the right-hand side of the penalty area.Dzsudzsak again took aim 10 minutes into the second period, his stinging 30-yard shot forcing Austria keeper Robert Almer to fist the punch behind for a corner.And Hungary grabbed a surprise lead just beyond the hour when Kleinheisler slipped in Szalai, who was played onside by Fuchs, with the powerful striker poking the ball underneath Almer for his first goal at any level since December 2014.Austria appeared to have levelled when Martin Hinteregger rifled in from the edge of the area, but referee Clement Turpin disallowed the goal for a foul on Tamas Kadar with Dragovic dismissed for a second booking.And Stieber triggered delirious celebrations when he raced from just inside the Austria half to beat Almer three minutes from time with a sublime chip as Hungary completed a stunning upset for their first European Championship win since 1964.",6/15/2016,Hungary earn shock 2 0 win over 10 man Austri,football,BORDEAUX,Kiraly;Marcel Koller;Laszlo;Zlatko Junuzovic.Arnautovic;Balazs Dzsudzsak;Kadar;Gabor Kiraly;Junuzovic.Arnautovic;Robert;Clement;Robert Almer;Zlatko;Stieber;Szalai;Gabor;Harnik;Hinteregger;David Alaba;Dzsudzsak;Dragovic;Adam;Laszlo Kleinheisler;Zoltan Stieber;David;Kleinheisler;Marcel;Martin Harnik;Marko;Lothar;Fuchs;Martin Hinteregger;Tamas Kadar;Lothar Matthaus;Balazs;Christian Fuchs;Zoltan;Almer;Martin;Marko Arnautovic.Szalai;Alaba;Arnautovic.Szalai;Adam Szalai;Matthaus;Christian;Turpin;Koller;Clement Turpin;Tamas,,Bayern Munich
"SEATTLE: Argentina maintained their 100 percent record at the Copa America Centenario on Tuesday with a 3-0 victory over hapless Bolivia.The tournament favorites, already assured of a quarter-final berth after wins over Chile and Panama, wrapped up their Group D campaign with an easy win at Seattles CenturyLink Field.The victory sees Argentina reach the last eight as group winners, handing them what in theory should be a straightforward assignment against Venezuela in Foxborough on Saturday.The two-time world champions are determined to end a 23-year wait for a major title after suffering agonizing defeats in the finals of the 2014 World Cup and last years Copa America.On current form few would bet against the South American giants, who could afford to omit Lionel Messi from their starting line-up following his hat-trick display against Panama.The match was effectively settled within the first quarter of an hour, with Tottenham Hotspur winger Erik Lamela opening the scoring with a deflected free-kick in the 13th minute.Two minutes later China-based forward Ezequiel Lavezzi marked his comeback from injury with a goal, volleying home from close range after Gonzalo Higuains downward header.Central defender Victor Cuesta made it 3-0 just after the half-hour, diverting home Lavezzis low cross in the 32nd minute.Argentina manager Gerardo Martino brought on Messi at half-time, and a one-sided second half soon became a question of when or if the Barcelona superstar could grab a 54th international goal to equal Gabriel Batistutas longstanding scoring record.However despite Argentinas dominance, Messi was unable to add to his teams tally, his best chance coming with a 25-yard curling freekick which flew just wide of the goal.",6/15/2016,Argentina outclass Bolivia to reach last eig,football,SEATTLE,Ezequiel Lavezzi;Gonzalo Higuains;Lavezzi;Batistutas;Ezequiel;Erik;Victor Cuesta;Lionel;Victor;Martino;Lamela;Higuains;Cuesta;Gerardo;Erik Lamela;Gonzalo;Gerardo Martino;Gabriel Batistutas;Gabriel;Lionel Messi;Messi,,Tottenham Hotspur;Copa America Centenario;Seattles

But this trip also provides an opportunity to pause to reflect on, and celebrate, the wider historical, cultural and community links that exist between our two great cricketing nations, Cameron said in the message.As you break your fast together on the eve of your departure to the UK, please accept my very best wishes for the Holy month of Ramadan.

It is also because of the power of sport to achieve all the things that I, as a diplomat, try to do to bring our two countries together. Our respective cricket teams  Men and Womens  have ambassadorial powers that I can only dream of.Sport is particularly powerful in reaching out to the young, who represent the future of our two countries  and are the focus of so much of the UKs work here. Indeed, alongside our education work, this magnificent British Council library, which I opened only two weeks ago is another important example of that.I havent forgotten who pays my salary, fond though I am of Pakistan, so I wont pretend that I will be supporting anyone other than the home team.

"Marseille: Antoine Griezmann struck late on before Dimitri Payet added a second in injury time as hosts France secured their ticket to the last 16 of Euro 2016 with a 2-0 win over Albania on Wednesday.France began their bid for a first European Championship title in 16 years with a nervous 2-1 win over Romania last Friday.But despite creating a host of scoring chances against the Balkan minnows in a stirring second half, it took Atletico Madrid striker Griezmann to rescue a pale version of Les Bleus with a 90th-minute header at the Stade Velodrome.Coach Didier Deschamps replaced under-performing midfielder Paul Pogba with Anthony Martial while Kingsley Coman replaced Griezmann for Frances first game at the Stade Velodrome since their triumphant World Cup campaign in 1998.It meant a change from a 4-3-3 to a 4-2-3-1, with Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud playing solo up front.But after a frustrating first half of few real chances for the hosts, Deschamps was quickly reconsidering his options.Albania, missing captain and ex-Marseille player Lorik Cana through suspension following his sending-off in the tournament debutants 1-0 defeat to Switzerland, deployed a defence-minded 4-5-1 that made their conservative tactics clear.And France, despite showing plenty of promise throughout, struggled to come up with the antidote.Payet, who hit a stunning winner for France last Friday, showed promise with a great delivery for Giroud but the strikers header was a yard over.Albania midfielder Ermir Lenjanis then sent a drive just wide but the Balkan minnows would threaten again.Frances offside trap was non-existent when Napoli defender Elseid Hysaj broke free on the right to collect a long ball and deliver a cross that deflected off Martial as Armando Sadiku ran in towards goal.It was a brief scare, and France responded with a string of mistakes that left Deschamps holding his head in his hands before the half hour.As widely expected, Pogba replaced Martial for the start of the second half, inspiring the hosts to a far improved performance.Seconds after kick off a great delivery from Giroud was helped on by Blaise Matuidi, but Comans header from six yards out bounced just wide.But France were given another scare when Bacary Sagna missed a dangerous delivery that came off the post, bounced off the head of Ledian Memushaj and went out for a goal kick.This time, the scare was big enough to prompt a rousing French response.Moments later, Payet met Girouds nice lay-off to hit an inviting delivery with the outside of his right boot towards the back post where Pogba rushed in only to fire inches over.When NGolo Kante made a timely interception to help set up Coman on the left, Giroud timed his jump to perfection but his header glanced wide on 67 minutes.Coman was replaced by Griezmann soon after, and moments later Giroud rose to meet Patrice Evras delicately chipped delivery to fire his header off the post.Deschamps replaced Giroud with former Marseille favourite Andre-Pierre Gignac with 13 minutes remaining, but as the hosts maintained their push for the opener it was Griezmann who broke the deadlock when he rose to meet Adil Ramis cross to beat Lazio keeper Etrit Berisha.It broke Albanias resolve and five minutes later Payet claimed his second of the competition with a fine curling strike that beat Berisha at his far post.",6/16/2016,France beat Albania to reach last 16 at Euro 2016,football,Marseille,Etrit Berisha.It;Matuidi;Adil Ramis;Blaise Matuidi;Dimitri;Paul Pogba;Sagna;Didier;Antoine;Ramis;Frances;Armando;Bacary;Payet;Hysaj;Girouds;Kingsley Coman;Memushaj;Coman;Giroud;Bacary Sagna;Antoine Griezmann;Cana;Evras;Dimitri Payet;Griezmann;Sadiku;Ermir Lenjanis;Ledian Memushaj;Adil;Didier Deschamps;Berisha;Deschamps;Comans;Lorik Cana;Lenjanis;Patrice;Paul;Anthony Martial;Olivier Giroud;Elseid;Armando Sadiku;Blaise;Martial;Patrice Evras;Berisha.It;Anthony;Ledian;Albanias;Kante;Ermir;Andre-Pierre Gignac;Gignac;Etrit;Andre-Pierre;Elseid Hysaj;Lorik;Kingsley;Olivier;Pogba,,Arsenal;Marseille;Lazio;Napoli;Atletico Madrid

"KUWAIT CITY: From Dubai to Tunis, Euro 2016 football fever is sweeping the Arab world, filling cafes and restaurants and overshadowing the nightly television soap operas that normally dominate Ramazan viewing.Every year, during the Muslim fasting month, television audiences soar as families gather in front of their sets after breaking the daytime fast.Usually the ratings are dominated by the dozens of rival soaps that are aired by state and private channels. But this year, Ramazan coincides with the Euros which are another massive draw.Cafes in the Egyptian capital have draped the flags of competing countries over their entrances to attract fans. Some games are played during the day, when devout Muslims are fasting, while others clash with the iftar meal which breaks the daily fast at sunset.In Tunisia, where most cafes are closed during daylight hours in Ramazan, the venue moves to peoples homes. Evening games begin a few minutes after Muslims break their fast, a time most Tunisians spend with their families watching television.Television viewing in the region peaks during Ramazan with ratings remaining high well into the night and advertisers devote large chunks of their budget to the small screens high season.With most games showing on foreign satellite channels, the main Tunisian channels have scheduled daily analysis programmes on the matches.Ramazan hasnt stopped people following the contest on big screens in the Gulf.In Kuwait, whose national team was banned by FIFA in October from taking part in World Cup qualifying matches because of alleged government interference in sports, fans take consolation in the Euros.Germany, the reigning world champions, are the most supported team in Kuwait and in many other Arab countries, exceeding defending European champions.In Dubai, one restaurant has erected a huge tent on the beach with big screens to show the games.",6/17/2016,Ramazan time Euro 2016 fever sweeps Arab world,football,KUWAIT,Ramazan,Ramazan,FIFA

"LAHORE: Pakistans top Test batsman Younis Khan has brushed aside the threat posed by Englands in-form pace attack as his team prepare to return to the scene of an infamous spot-fixing scandal in 2010.Khan said Pakistans familiarity with the likes of Stuart Broad and James Anderson would blunt their potency when they open a four-Test series at Lords on July 14.The home of cricket will provide a tough opening environment for Pakistan after the spot-fixing case of 2010, which ended with jail terms for young fast bowler Mohammad Amir and two other players.Amir, now 24, is back in Pakistans squad after completing a ban from cricket but Khan said his team-mates now wanted to put the past behind them and enjoy playing at the historic London ground.""It is always a pleasure whenever you play in Lords,"" told AFP at a dinner organised by Britains High Commission in Lahore.""The tradition and using that dressing room and that ground... in my mind its always a challenge and a pleasure for me so playing cricket in England is all about that.""Englands fast bowlers combined to take 33 wickets between them in their recent 2-0 rout of a Sri Lankan side missing recent retirees such as Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene.Andersons 21 wickets came at a phenomenal 10.8 runs apiece, but Khan, the lynchpin of Pakistans batting for more than a decade, said his team would not roll over as easily.""No doubt about Anderson and Broad -- they are the top bowlers these days. But we play regularly against Broad and Finn and Anderson,"" he said.strong>- Last hurrah? -</strongThe two teams last clashed in the UAE, where Pakistan plays its home games because of security concerns, in October-November 2015 with the South Asian side prevailing 2-0 in the three match series.They also played in the UAE in 2012, when Pakistan rolled over the English 3-0.Then, as now, Khan and fellow veteran Misbah-ul-Haq (age 42) are seen as key to holding up a batting order that has traditionally been troubled by quality swing bowling.""If you go there and play according to your plans youll be successful in any conditions and against any bowler,"" he said.It is a strategy that has paid dividends for Khan in the past even in English conditions, with its pacey pitches that encourage movement in the air.In five previous Tests on English soil he has maintained an average of 52.22 -- one run shy of his overall career figure -- and managed one century along with three fifties.Now in the twilight of a career that has seen him amass 31 Test centuries -- tenth on the overall list and the highest number by any current player -- Khan remained coy on his future plans.""Maybe it will be my final tour,"" he said, before quickly adding: ""As a cricketer and as a top sportsman I feel very comfortable with my fitness and my form so God willing (if) I perform the way I perform for my country maybe I will play for four-five more years, maybe.""Beyond Khan and Misbah, no Pakistani batsman has broken into the worlds top 10 for many years, but the ethnic Pashtun said he was confident about the younger players who are waiting in the wings.""Asad Shafiq is there, Azhar Ali is there, then after them there are the youngsters are upcoming,"" he said.""Whenever a top cricketer retires everyone thinks after him what should we do.

"LAHORE: Pakistan cricket captain Misbah-ul Haq hopes the upcoming test series in England will help spur the return of international cricket to the South Asian nation after a seven-year absence due to security fears.Pakistan has not staged test matches since a 2009 gun attack on Sri Lanka's team bus in Lahore killed six Pakistani policemen and a van driver. Some players and a local umpire were injured.Improved security in Pakistan in recent years has prompted calls for international teams to return but test playing nations have so far refused to tour a country where Islamist militants still pose a threat.Misbah told Reuters he hoped the four-test series in England ""would help revive cricket series in Pakistan"".Pakistan last played test matches in England in 2012 and the 42-year-old batsman said he expected an ""exciting"" tour after such a long gap.""It is a big tour for Pakistan,"" Misbah said late on Thursday during a send-off dinner for the Pakistani team hosted by Britain's High Commissioner to Pakistan, Thomas Drew.Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron also sent a good luck message to Pakistan's team, saying: ""I hope that one day in the not too distant future I will be able to wish the England cricket team a successful tour of Pakistan.""Pakistan's formidable pace attack, spearheaded by left-armers Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz, will face a resurgent and youthful England team captained by Alastair Cook, who last month became the first England cricketer to reach 10,000 test runs.""England cricket team is a strong and balanced one,"" Pakistan's experienced all-rounder Muhammad Hafeez said.

"Beer-swilling English football fans bathed in public fountains on Thursday evening in the northern France town on Lille to celebrate their team's victory over Wales in nearby Lens, with little sign of the tensions seen there in previous nights.Police were braced for the kind of violence that threatened England and Russia with expulsion from the tournament and led to the use of tear gas on Wednesday to disperse rowdy English fans in Lille.But on Thursday, fans flooded back from Lens singing and playfully kicking a football around as they exited Lille's rail station. Occasional showers of rain also helped keep the atmosphere calmer.A Reuters photographer saw police detain one of a group of fans who were fighting in Lille.

"East Rutherford, United States: Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina was the hero as Colombia slayed their penalty shoot-out jinx to defeat Peru and advance to the semi-finals of the Copa America Centenario here Friday.Ospina pulled off a superb save deep into injury time to deny Peru a goal before saving a spot-kick from Peru defender Miguel Trauco in the shoot-out to clinch a nailbiting win for Colombia.A largely disappointing quarter-final in front of 79,194 fans at East Rutherfords MetLife Stadium was settled in penalties after the two sides finished 90 minutes deadlocked at 0-0.After Colombia drilled their first three penalties, the tide turned in their favor when Trauco saw his effort blocked by Ospina.Sebastian Perez then scored Colombias fourth penalty to put his 4-2 up and when Perus Christian Cueva blasted his spot-kick over the bar Colombia were through.Victory was especially sweet for Colombia, who had exited the competition last year at the same stage to Argentina.They will now play either Mexico or Chile in the semi-finals in Chicago next Wednesday.<br/> ""Sometimes you win sometimes you lose, and today luck was on our side in the penalties,"" Colombias James Rodriguez said.""Our goal was to get into the semi-finals at least and weve done that. Now we want to win the title,"" the Real Madrid star added.Goalkeeper Ospina said he believed Colombia could reach the June 26 final.""I contributed my bit, and we want to keep going from here,"" Ospina said. ""We can get to the final. The semi will be tough regardless of whoever we face.""The tone for a niggly encounter was set in the first 18 minutes, which saw no fewer than 11 fouls committed, mostly coming from Peru.The stop-start nature of the contest hampered Colombias attempts to build momentum and made for a mostly frustrating half for the talented 2014 World Cup quarter-finalists.Carlos Bacca was the first to threaten the Peru goal, but his shot from a tight angle after seven minutes hit the post.",6/18/2016,Colombia defeat Peru to reach to Copa semi,football,East Rutherford,Ospina.Sebastian;Miguel Trauco;Miguel;Perus;Carlos Bacca;Bacca;Ospina.Sebastian Perez;Cueva;Colombias James Rodriguez;David Ospina;Perez;James;Ospina;Colombias;Trauco;David;Christian;Rodriguez;Perus Christian Cueva;Carlos,,Real Madrid
"LONDON: Alex Hartley, the uncapped left-arm spinner, and Fran Wilson, who last played an international match in 2011, earned call-ups to the England Women's squad of 15 for the first two one-dayers against Pakistan Women, following strong performances for England Women's Academy in Sri Lanka earlier this year.Amy Jones has been designated to take over the wicketkeeping duties from Sarah Taylor, while Lauren Winfield, has been named as a back-up option. Taylor is currently on an indefinite break from the game to recover from stress and anxiety issues that have riddled her for the last four years.June 20 will also officially mark a change of guard in England women's cricket as Heather Knight, the allrounder, will lead the side for the first time following Charlotte Edwards retirement in May. Knight will have in her ranks a top-quality pace attack led by Anya Shrubsole, the newly-appointed vice-captain, and Katherine Brunt, who is one short of 100 ODI wickets. Beth Langston, the seamer, has been ruled out of selection because of an ankle injury.""Monday is going to be a very proud day for our new captain and vice-captain, Heather Knight and Anya Shrubsole,"" Mark Robinson, the head coach, said. ""Under their leadership we will start a new chapter for the England Women's team against a Pakistan side that cannot be underestimated. Pakistan showed everyone during the ICC World T20 how dangerous they can be, when they beat the hosts India on their own patch. They represent a fresh challenge that as a squad we can't wait to get out there and tackle.""All three ODIs of the series will count towards the ICC Women's Championship that will determine the top four direct qualifiers for the 2017 Women's World Cup to be held in England next year. England and Pakistan are currently placed sixth and seventh, respectively. However, England have an incentive of moving to No. 3 if they win the series, while Pakistan can jump two spots should they win all three matches.""Historically, we have a strong record against Pakistan, but the quality of international women's cricket is rising all the time, so we are looking forward to the challenge of facing them on home soil over the next few weeks,"" Robinson said.

"The governor of the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro declared a state of financial emergency on Friday, requesting federal funds to help fulfill obligations for public services during the Olympics, which start Aug. 5.Emergency measures are needed to avoid ""a total collapse in public security, health, education, transport and environmental management,"" a decree in the state's Official Gazette said. The state's revenue has slumped in the last two years as global oil prices have collapsed.The announcement followed this week's visit to the Olympic city of Rio de Janeiro by Interim President Michel Temer, who said the federal government would ensure obligations are met.The city is expecting about 500,000 foreign visitors during the Olympic Games. The local organising committee for the games did not immediately respond to requests for comment.While the majority of Olympic infrastructure costs have been spread across city, state and federal budgets, with some financing from private companies, the state is responsible for most day-to-day security and health services in Rio.The state of Rio expects a budget deficit of over 19 billion reais ($5.56 billion) this year as spending planned before oil prices fell outstrips revenue that is tumbling during Brazil's worst recession since the 1930s.Rio state's debt has been downgraded several times.On Wednesday, Fitch Ratings knocked Rio's debt rating to B- from B+, saying the state was suffering ""a fast-deteriorating liquidity position.""Since late last year, the state has been forced to delay pension and salary payments and shutter some schools and hospitals, where crucial supplies, including medicines and syringes, are lacking.Brazil is also facing an outbreak of the Zika virus, which has been linked to the birth defect microcephaly in which babies are born with abnormally small heads frequently associated with developmental issues.",6/18/2016,Rio declares financial emergency requests funding for Olympi,olympics,,Michel Temer;Michel;Temer;Rio,Rio,
"TOULOUSE, FRANCE: Italy moved into the knockout stages of Euro 2016 and continued to defy their doubters as Eder scored two minutes from fulltime to secure a 1-0 win over a shot-shy and unadventurous Sweden on Friday.Eder ended a great run by firing home to move Italy clear at the top of Group E on six points after two matches following their 2-0 victory over Belgium in their opening encounter.The result left Sweden in an uncomfortable position with one point after two games ahead of their final group clash against Belgium next week.Sweden were well organised at the back but toothless in attack, with their danger man Zlatan Ibrahimovic looking a shadow of his brilliant best and hardly creating a chance.Italy, who came into the tournament with questions surrounding the strength of their squad, but surprised many with their superb performance against a highly-fancied Belgium side, relied on their trademark, tight defence against the Swedes.They rarely threatened up front, however, until Marco Parolo hit the crossbar with a header shortly before Eder netted the winner.""It was a difficult game,"" Italy coach Antonio Conte told Rai Sport. ""We struggled in the first half.""The boys did well to ride the storm and hurt Sweden when we needed to.""Italy had been praised for their unity and work rate in their opening win over Belgium, but appeared to have no answer to Sweden's organised rearguard until Eder's late intervention.Sweden coach Erik Hamren had criticised their lack of attacking vitality following their opening 1-1 draw with Ireland, and while there was an improvement in their overall performance, Ibrahimovic once again failed to provide a cutting edge and live up to his billing.""We were much better than the Italians for periods, but we didnt create really dangerous chances,"" Sweden midfielder Albin Ekdal told Swedish broadcaster SVT.Sweden are still without a shot on target at the tournament, although Martin Olsson proved a menacing threat down the left, sending an effort just over the bar on 18 minutes having set the tone with an early cross that prompted a nervous clearance from Giorgio Chiellini.Olsson's frequent forays left space for Antonio Candreva, but Andreas Isaksson and Erik Johansson combined to clear his testing deliveries, while Ibrahimovic flashed a close-range header wide towards the end of the first half.Having masterminded victory over the Belgians, Conte's tactics were completely neutralised during the opening 45 minutes in Toulouse and his side appeared unsettled as a result.""At halftime Conte told us we were too slow and he was right,"" Parolo told Rai Sport.""We changed the tempo after the break and we deserved our victory.""Conte introduced Simone Zaza in the 60th minute and he had a decisive role in the winner, heading a Chiellini throw in into the path of Eder.The forward then cut in from the left -- evading Andreas Granqvist's attempted tackle -- and sent a curling right-footed shot round Isaksson to take Italy through.",6/18/2016,Late Eder goal sends Italy through to last 16,football,TOULOUSE,Parolo;Zaza;Martin Olsson;Eder;Erik Hamren;Erik;Giorgio;Sport;Antonio Conte;Albin;Rai Sport;Ibrahimovic;Andreas Isaksson;Conte;Andreas;Marco;Hamren;Zlatan;Candreva;Giorgio Chiellini.Olsson;Olsson;Antonio;Zlatan Ibrahimovic;Simone;Antonio Candreva;Andreas Granqvist;Erik Johansson;Simone Zaza;Albin Ekdal;Martin;Granqvist;Isaksson;Johansson;Ekdal;Chiellini.Olsson;Rai;Marco Parolo,Eder,Rai Sport
"Cristiano Ronaldo will continue to take penalties for Portugal despite losing his touch from the spot for both club and country, coach Fernando Santos said on Sunday.Ronaldo, Portugal's all-time leading scorer, missed a penalty in the 0-0 draw with Austria in Group F on Saturday and has failed to hit the target in four of his last five penalties for Portugal and Real Madrid.""If there is a penalty in the next game, Cristiano Ronaldo will take it and he will score,"" Santos told reporters. ""He is used to scoring goals, he is a winner and he also reacts well when he makes a mistake. That is what we expect from him.""Ronaldo, who won a record 128th cap on Saturday, has had a disappointing Euro 2016 so far, failing to convert any of several good chances as Portugal have drawn both of their games.Left-back Raphael Guerreiro has increased the pressure on Ronaldo's place as the free kick specialist after scoring with a superbly-taken effort in a 3-0 friendly win over Norway before the tournament when Ronaldo was not playing.""Cristiano always wants to take the free kicks and it has always been him who has taken them,"" said Santos. ""If Raphael had not scored that goal, nobody would be talking about this.""""We played really well against Austria without scoring and we have to continue with this attitude. We made Austria, who are ranked 10th in the world, look like a small team.""Santos said Portugal should not be ashamed of ""being ugly"" and that he had told his family that he would not be coming home until the day after the Euro 2016 final when he expected a party.""Sometimes, I get the feeling that we are ashamed about being ugly, or not being pretty,"" he said. ""If we have to be ugly and that brings us efficiency, we have to be ugly.

"Cristiano Ronaldo missed a second-half penalty and had a late headed effort disallowed as Portugal's future at Euro 2016 looked in jeopardy following a 0-0 draw against Austria in a wide open Group F on Saturday.Ronaldo won his 128th cap to break the record of Luis Figo, who was watching from the stands, but his landmark occasion turned into a night of torment for the Real Madrid luminary.He fired his 79th minute spot kick against the post -- the fourth penalty he has missed in his last five for club and country -- having already squandered several chances in an entertaining game at the Parc des Princes.Ronaldo then thought he had made amends in the 85th minute by grabbing the winner with a header but it was ruled out for offside. He has had 20 shots so far at the tournament, more than nine entire teams have managed, but has still to score.Hailed as potentially tough opponents after an impressive qualifying campaign, Austria, ranked 10th in the world, again failed to live up to expectations after a 2-0 defeat by Hungary in their opener.Hungary top the group with four points after earlier snatching a 1-1 draw against Iceland, who are level with Portugal on two points and ahead of Austria on one.Portugal, who were knocked out in the first round at the 2014 World Cup, face a tense final match against Hungary while Austria will play Iceland on Wednesday.Asked about Ronaldo, Portugal coach Fernando Santos snapped.""I understand you and don't talk to you about Cristiano,"" he told a news conference.""Of course we're going through a tough time but we need to switch back immediately and can't wallow in our own misery. The next match is a final for us.""We faced a very strong Portuguese team but we ran a lot and we fought hard,"" said Asutria coach Marcel Koller.strong>THREE CHANCES</strongPortugal, held 1-1 by Iceland in their opener, had three opportunities in the space of three minutes early on but Nani, Vieirinha and William Carvalho were denied by alert keeper Robert Almer.""Messi, Messi,"" sang the Austria fans gleefully after Ronaldo missed the target as he latched on to Nani's cross into the area in the 22nd minute.Portugal came closer seven minutes later when Nani's header hit the woodwork.Stefan Ilsanker bossed the Austria midfield, breaking up several Portugal attacks and orchestrating play for his team mates as David Alaba appeared to be having an off night.Ilsanker provided Austria with their first shot on target early in the second half with a powerful low drive that was tipped away by Rui Patricio.Ronaldo was then denied twice in quick succession, Almer parrying away a shot from 20 metres and a header to keep his team afloat as Portugal stepped up the pressure.Alaba and Ricardo Quaresma, both supposed to provide a creative spark for their respective teams, were substituted midway through the second half after disappointing displays.Ronaldo had the perfect chance to snatch the points for Portugal after being fouled by Martin Hinteregger but his penalty struck Almer's right-hand post and six minutes later he was given offside after planting a precise header into the net.After his wretched night, Ronaldo, much criticised already at the tournament for a lack of humility after his dismissive comments about Iceland's tactics in their previous match, demonstrated a dignified side.When a fan stepped onto the pitch at the final whistle, Ronaldo asked a couple of stewards to let the intruder take a selfie with him.

"Malahide, Ireland: Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews said his side will have to be at their best to beat England in the five-match one-day international series which starts on Tuesday.Mathews was speaking after overseeing a 2-0 ODI series victory over Ireland in Malahide after the second match was won by an emphatic 136-run margin on Saturday.Opening batsman Kusal Perera, who would have missed the tour had a drugs ban not been rescinded following a faulty doping analysis, made a century to build the platform for his sides huge total of 377 for 8.""We still can improve a lot in all departments. It was a pretty convincing victory today, but we need to be at our best to beat England,"" said Mathews.Eoin Morgans England have improved dramatically in 50-over cricket since the Sri Lankans thrashed them by nine wickets in Wellington during last years World Cup.Seekkugge Prasanna came in a three to pinch-hit in explosive style, bludgeoning nine sixes and five fours to leave his previous best ODI score of 42 far behind with 95 from just 46 balls.The fifth and sixth overs of the Ireland reply were maidens and when captain William Porterfield was out to the first ball of the seventh over, Ireland, who have never beaten Sri Lanka in five attempts, could not cope. It needed a last wicket stand of 54 between Andrew McBrine and former England international Boyd Rankin to get the Ireland total over 200.The man of the series was Sri Lankas Dasun Shanaka, who scored 42 off 19 balls and took five wickets on his debut in the tourists 76-run win in the first match on Thursday and Mathews has high hopes for the 24-year-old.Perera took advantage of the very good pitch to score 135, his second ODI century, before he was the second of three dismissals in the space of five balls. <br/> He faced 128 balls, with 16 fours and two sixes, and was happy to play second fiddle to Prasanna, who dominated an electrifying second-wicket stand of 161 in 89 balls.The late flurry of wickets allowed Ireland to restrict Sri Lanka to 67 from the last eight overs, when a total of 400 had looked likely.Suranga Lakmal was Sri Lankas most successful bowler. Sharing the new ball with Mathews, he dismissed both Ireland openers in the space of 10 balls, broke the stubborn seventh wicket stand between Stuart Poynter (36) and McBrine (79 off 64 balls) and added a fourth wicket at a personal cost of just 38 runs.Prasanna completed a fine all-round game with two for 32 from eight overs, and although Shanaka took only one wicket in his second game, it was the big one of the dangerous Kevin OBrien.",6/19/2016,Mathews tells Sri Lanka to up their game against England,cricket,Malahide,Mathews;Boyd Rankin;Kusal;Rankin;Angelo;Kusal Perera;Sri;Angelo Mathews;Porterfield;Poynter;OBrien;Prasanna;William Porterfield;Malahide;Dasun;Andrew;Boyd;Andrew McBrine;Stuart Poynter;William;Kevin;Shanaka;Kevin OBrien;Stuart;Sri Lankas Dasun Shanaka;McBrine;Lankas;Perera,Mathews;Angelo Mathews,Mathews.Eoin Morgans England

Their previous biggest loss was a 6-0 rout by West Germany at the 1978 World Cup in Argentina.The rout was also only one goal away from equalling Mexicos heaviest ever defeat in any international, an 8-0 thrashing by England in London in 1961.Vargas grabbed his fourth goal in the 74th minute to give Chile a 6-0 lead.<br/> But the punishment did not finish there with Edson Puch adding a seventh in the 88th minute for his second of the match.Chile, winners of last years Copa America on home soil, had faced an intimidating atmosphere in front of a crowd of 70,547 people at the Levis Stadium, home of the San Francisco 49ers.But despite the overwhelmingly pro-Mexico crowd, Chile were quicker to settle, with Puch opening the scoring on 16 minutes when he steered in a rebound from Marcelo Diazs shot after Guillermo Ochoa could only parry away.Vargas grabbed a second a minute before half-time to stun the crowd into silence as the teams headed in for the break.Chile then cut loose early in the second half with slick inter-play ripping apart a feeble Mexican defense at will.Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez made it 3-0 in the 49th minute before two more goals from Vargas in the 52nd and 57th minutes piled on the agony for Mexico.Several Mexican players visibly wilted in the face of the onslaught, and for periods the game resembled a training exercise for Chile as they swept forward relentlessly.<br/> Vargass fourth made it 6-0 on the night before Puch then toe-poked home to complete the scoring.Brazilian referee Heber Lopes spared Mexico the possibility of greater humiliation, whistling for full-time almost on the stroke of 90 minutes, with no time added on.",6/19/2016,Vargas scores four as Chile thrash Mexico 7 0,football,Santa Clara,Ochoa;Eduardo;Alexis;Clara;Edson Puch;Edson;Alexis Sanchez;Marcelo Diazs;Puch;Santa Clara;Santa;Eduardo Vargas;Heber Lopes;Heber;Guillermo;Lopes;Marcelo;Diazs;Guillermo Ochoa;Sanchez;Vargas,Vargas;Eduardo Vargas,Puch
"Foxborough, United States: Lionel Messi scored a record-equalling 54th international goal as Argentina outclassed Venezuela 4-1 to book their place in the semi-finals of the Copa America Centenario here Saturday.The Barcelona superstar scored his fourth goal of the tournament in the 60th minute at the Gillette Stadium to equal Gabriel Batistutas long-time Argentina international goalscoring record.Messi also created a goal for Gonzalo Higuain, who scored twice, and second half substitute Erik Lamela as Argentina set up a semi-final against the United States in Houston on Tuesday.Messi is determined to lead Argentina to their first trophy in 23 years after a series of agonizing near-misses which include defeats in the finals of last years Copa America and the 2014 World Cup final.Messis genius created the opening goal after eight minutes, with the playmaker lofting a sublime curling pass to pick out Higuains run into the area.Napoli forward Higuain still had plenty to do but skillfully directed a first time strike past Venezuela goalkeeper Dani Hernandez for a wonderful goal.Argentina remained firmly in control but were jolted in the 27th minute when Nicolas Gaitan picked up a needless yellow card for a kick on Alexander Gonzalez that will see him suspended for the semi-final.Argentinas dominance clearly had Venezuela rattled, and the Vinotintos defensive unease led to the next goal.A slack backpass from Arquimedes Figuera went straight to Higuain in space, and the striker coolly rounded Hernandez to stroke home his second of the night to make it 2-0 after 29 minutes.But just when it looked as if the floodgates would open, Venezuela rallied impressively and had Argentina rocking with a series of chances.<br/> <br/> West Bromwich Albion striker Salomon Rondon forced a save from Sergio Romero and hit the woodwork in quick succession.Romero was left scrambling to save once again just before half-time, when fullback Rolf Feltschers long-range shot deflected off Gabriel Mercado and looped up and over the Argentina keeper.Venezuela looked to have a justifiable claim for a penalty when Higuain brought down Josef Martinez in the box but Mexican referee Roberto Garcia was unmoved. <br/> Seconds later though Garcia was pointing to the spot after Romero clumsily bundled over Martinez for a clear penalty.But Venezuelas pressure went unrewarded when Luis Manuel Seijas tried a risky ""Panenka"" down the middle which Romero read and gathered with ease.Venezuela were unable to renew their period of pressure in the second half, and Messi effectively put the contest to bed with his record-equalling goal in the 60th minute, which came after Argentina pressed high to force a turnover.Gaitan won the tackle and passed to Messi, who quickly played a one-two with the Benfica winger before poking his finish between Hernandezs legs.Rondon pulled a goal back with a header in the 70th minute, but Messis response was instant, threading a pass to Lamela whose shot crept in at Hernandezs near post.",6/19/2016,Messi record as Argentina thrash Venezu,football,Foxborough,Rolf Feltschers;Martinez;Hernandez;Sergio Romero;Josef;Manuel;Erik;Romero;Gonzalez;Lamela;Josef Martinez;Gabriel Batistutas;Lionel Messi;Roberto Garcia;Figuera;Gaitan;Salomon;Batistutas;Nicolas Gaitan;Mercado;Roberto;Rolf;Garcia;Luis;Dani;Erik Lamela;Gabriel;Messi;Alexander Gonzalez;Arquimedes;Alexander;Gabriel Mercado;Nicolas;Arquimedes Figuera;Lionel;Rondon;Salomon Rondon;Higuain;Gonzalo;Seijas;Messis;Sergio;Dani Hernandez;Luis Manuel Seijas;Feltschers;Gonzalo Higuain,Messi;Lionel Messi,West Bromwich Albion;Barcelona;Copa America Centenario;Benfica
"Oakmont, United States: Shane Lowry is determined to enjoy his moment in the spotlight as he leads the US Open going into Sundays final day.The burly, bearded Irishman showed superb form on Saturday to climb his way past some of the best golfers in the world and take a two shot lead with four holes to go in his third round when darkness intervened.Now he will have to get up at the crack of dawn on Sunday and finish those holes off before regrouping for the final 18.It is something the 29-year-old from County Offaly, the son of 1982 All-Ireland winning footballer Brendan Lowry, says he is looking forward to.""Ive been beating myself up over the last six months trying to get in this position,"" he said. ""Im here now.

"Malahide, Ireland: Kusal Perera and Seekkuge Prasanna both made career-best scores as Sri Lanka beat Ireland by 136 runs in the second one-day international at Malahide on Saturday.Victory saw Sri Lanka enjoy their second heartening win in a matter of days as they took the two-match series 2-0 and gave them a confidence boost ahead of their upcoming five-game ODI campaign in England.Put into bat, they amassed 377 for eight. Perera top-scored with an ODI best 135 and Prasanna made 95 -- his highest score at this level.Ireland, in reply, were bowled out for 241.Sri Lanka, again sent into bat as they had been in their 76-run win in the first ODI at Malahide on Thursday, were well-placed at the half-way stage.And when Suranga Lakmal and the recalled Farveez Maharoof removed Irelands top three with just 41 on the board, the rest of the match proved a formality.John Anderson, an accountant and the only amateur in the Ireland side, showed promise for the future with 34 and Andy McBrine, batting at No 8, finished the innings in some style with 79 from 64 balls, including seven fours and two sixes.McBrine and Boyd Rankin (18 not out) delayed the inevitable with a last wicket stand of 54 -- both making their highest scores for Ireland and Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews had to bring himself back to break the partnership and win the match with five overs to spare.Sri Lanka, put in on another excellent batting pitch, made the perfect start with Kusal Perera and Danuska Gunathilaka sharing an opening stand of 147.Gunathilaka was the first to go, in the 27th over, for 63, just two short of his ODI best, but both Perera and Prasanna easily passed their previous highest scores at this level.Prasanna, promoted to a pinch-hitting role at number three, played his role to perfection to more than double his career best in a superb display of hitting.He was dismissed five runs short of a deserved century having faced just 46 balls with nine sixes and five fours and he dominated the second wicket stand of 161 with Perera which took just 93 balls.Perera reached his second ODI hundred from 105 balls with 10 fours and two sixes and added another 35 before he was caught at mid-wicket off Middlesexs Tim Murtagh.In all he faced 128 balls and finished with 16 fours and two sixes.Sri Lanka were on course for a total in excess of 400 but Ireland pulled them back by taking four wickets for 13 runs in the last three overs, although by then the damage had been done.Barry McCarthy, a 23-year-old seamer in only his second international, was Irelands most impressive bowler, finishing with two for 52.By contrast Boyd Rankin, in his first home series for five years after appearing for England, finished with one for 86 from his 10 overs.Ireland will now look for an improved showing when they face Pakistan in a two-match home ODI series in August.",6/19/2016,Perera ton sets up SLanka series win over Ireland,cricket,Malahide,Mathews;Boyd Rankin;Kusal;Rankin;Angelo;Kusal Perera;Angelo Mathews;Danuska;Prasanna;Lakmal;Suranga Lakmal;Middlesexs;Malahide;Gunathilaka;Murtagh.In;McCarthy;Seekkuge Prasanna;Seekkuge;Boyd;Andy McBrine;Middlesexs Tim Murtagh.In;Farveez;Anderson;Farveez Maharoof;Danuska Gunathilaka;Suranga;Tim;Maharoof;Andy;McBrine;Perera,Perera;Kusal Perera,ODI

"BENGALURU: India fast bowler Mohammed Shami has offered positive feedback on the pink ball in Indian conditions, after it was used on an experimental basis during a domestic game at Eden Gardens.In April, India's cricket board decided that one game of an upcoming three-test series against New Zealand would be a day-night affair, pending trials of the pink ball.The 26-year-old, who picked up five wickets playing for Mohun Bagan in the day-night final, said South Asian conditions favoured swing with the pink ball, which was an exciting prospect.""With red or white balls, there was some visibility problem as it took (on) the colour of grass,"" he was quoted as saying by the Press Trust of India.""Definitely I will prefer this (pink) ball, this is much better.

"Long-hitting American Dustin Johnson, seeking major redemption after several near-misses in recent years, won the 116th U.S. Open on Sunday amid high drama and initial uncertainty over his victory margin.In pursuit of his first grand slam crown, the world number six played clutch golf under intense pressure at brutally difficult Oakmont Country Club, finishing in style as he sank a short birdie putt at the last.Having negotiated the final seven holes under notice that he might be penalised for a rules infraction on the fifth green, despite being cleared by another official at the time, he was docked a shot after the round's completion, with his score amended to a closing 69 for a four-under winning total of 276.After sinking the final putt to clinch his 10th PGA Tour victory, Johnson pumped his right fist in delight, and then lifted his putter to acknowledge the loud roars from the crowd before being embraced by his caddie.""Feels good, feels really good, feels well deserved,"" an emotional Johnson said after finishing three shots in front of fellow Americans Jim Furyk (66) and Scott Piercy (69), and Ireland's Shane Lowry (76).Lowry had been four ahead after the weather-delayed third round was completed earlier on Sunday but he struggled in the conditions while piling up seven bogeys.""I've had a lot of opportunities that I didn't quite get done, so this one's definitely really sweet,"" said Johnson. ""I knew I was swinging well, and I just kept thinking, it's just me and the course.""I'm playing against the course. I can't control what anyone else does. So I just tried to hit golf shots, tried to hit it on the correct side of the hole, and two-putt.""The rules controversy was sparked when Johnson's ball moved slightly as the American was preparing to attempt his par putt at the fifth hole, shortly after his birdie attempt there from five feet broke left and slid past the cup.He denied having caused the movement and the official accompanying the pairing decided not to levy a penalty.After being informed on the 12th tee by a U.S. Golf Association official that he might be penalised after the round, Johnson ran up a three-putt bogey at the 14th but otherwise displayed nerves of steel as he negotiated the closing stretch.He rolled in a 10-footer to save par at the 16th and thunderous roars of ""DJ, DJ, DJ"" rang out as the crowd gave vocal support to the tournament leader in his bid for a first major victory after a series of heartbreaks in the past.Johnson had previously recorded 11 top-10s in the majors without winning, including two-runner-up spots, and he missed a three-foot putt at the final hole to hand last year's U.S. Open at Chambers Bay to Jordan Spieth.On Sunday, however, Johnson was remarkably composed in the circumstances and made several clutch putts on a day when the entire field struggled on greens running lightning-fast.""After last year, to come back and perform like this, I think it shows what kind of golfer I am,"" said the 31-year-old. ""I've knocked on the door a bunch of times. To finally get that major win, it's huge.""American world number two Spieth finished a disappointing title defence with a 75 for a nine-over total of 289.",6/20/2016,Dustin Johnson wins first major golf title amid rules controversy,golf,,Shane Lowry;Shane;Johnson;Furyk;Piercy;Dustin;Jim;Scott Piercy;Dustin Johnson;Jim Furyk;Lowry;Scott,Dustin Johnson,Spieth;Chambers Bay;U.S. Golf Association;Oakmont Country Club

"England put Slovakia on the rack for long spells but were forced to settle for a 0-0 draw on Monday, frustrating coach Roy Hodgson as his side reached the knockout stages despite slipping behind Wales in their group at Euro 2016.England's failure to beat Slovakia, who came third in Group B, and should also go through to the last 16, means they will now face the runners-up in Group F instead of a potentially easier tie against one of the third-placed teams.""It's certainly very disappointing that once again we've had all of the play and a lot of opportunities in and around the Slovakia box and we've not been able to take one,"" Hodgson told a news conference.""I can't deny that's both frustrating and disappointing.

"Wales enjoyed their greatest day in football for more than half a century by overwhelming Russia 3-0 on Monday to win Group B at Euro 2016 ahead of their oldest rivals England.It was an outcome that had seemed unlikely when England beat them 2-1 last Thursday, and the thousands of Welsh supporters could have been forgiven for a feeling of disbelief as they celebrated every touch of the ball with ""oles"" before finally feeling free to chant ""we are top of the league"".They will play a third-placed team in Paris on Saturday while England face the Group F runners-up and Wales will go into the knockout stage with realistic hopes of reaching the last eight.""It was never about beating England, it was about qualifying,"" Wales manager Chris Coleman told reporters, adding that he had never seen a better performance from a Welsh team.Russia, bottom of the standings with one point, obtained with an undeserved last-minute equaliser against England, go home with much to think about before they host the World Cup in two years time under a new coach.The story of the night, however, was a Welsh one.In what had been described as the country's biggest game since the 1958 World Cup quarter-final, they rediscovered the attacking brio that enabled them to beat Slovakia in the opening game.Gareth Bale, the scorer of a direct free kick in each of the two previous games to equal a European Championship record, was close with several fine efforts before becoming the first player since Milan Baros in 2004 to score in three successive games at the European finals.He was outstanding in running at a Russian defence that allowed far too much space to him and Aaron Ramsey, breaking in support of Sam Vokes, the surprise selection in attack in place of Hal Robson-Kanu.That defence was not helped by a revamped midfield being outplayed by Joe Ledley and the tigerish Joe Allen.Russia survived an early Bale chance but were two goals down inside 20 minutes after strikes by Ramsey, named man of the match, and wing back Neil Taylor.Bale made further chances for Vokes and Ramsey before the latter, Wales' only other regular Champions League player, returned the compliment twice in the second half.""Weve topped the group which nobody probably saw coming,"" Ramsey said.""Our main target was to get out of the group.

"India's Kedar Jadhav blasted his highest score in Twenty20 internationals as they beat Zimbabwe by three runs in a tense finish to claim the three-match series 2-1 at the Harare Sports Club on Wednesday.Zimbabwe won the toss and chose to bowl first, restricting the tourists to 138 for six in their 20 overs on a slow wicket as Jadhav top-scored with 58 from 42 balls.But the hosts battled to keep up with the scoring rate and went into the final over of the match, bowled by Barinder Sran (2-31), needing 21 for victory.When the first two balls of the over went for 12 runs a sensational victory looked on the cards, but Sran came back well and bowled Elton Chigumbura (16) off the last delivery of the innings to leave Zimbabwe agonisingly short of a series victory.It was the first time on India's six-match limited overs tour that they batted first and, after starts for Lokesh Rahul (22) and Ambati Rayudu (20), Jadhav provided the impetus the innings desperately needed as he blazed seven fours and a six.India's opening bowlers restricted the run-rate well as Zimbabwe reached 59-2 at the halfway mark of their innings, with Sran going for just 14 in his first three overs and Dhawal Kulkarni ending with figures of 2-23 in his allotted four.Vusi Sibanda (28 from 23 balls) top scored for the hosts as sevral batsmen made starts but could not match Jadhavs half-century heroics.India also won 3-0 in the one-day international series that preceded the 20-over games.",6/22/2016,Jadhav leads India to T20 series win over Zimbab,cricket,India,Barinder Sran;Rahul;Rayudu;Elton Chigumbura;Chigumbura;Kedar Jadhav;Kedar;Sran;Dhawal Kulkarni;Lokesh;Sibanda;Elton;Barinder;Dhawal;Lokesh Rahul;Ambati Rayudu;Ambati;Kulkarni;Jadhav,Jadhav;Kedar Jadhav,Harare Sports Club

"NEW DELHI: Indias Saina Nehwal eschews the ""natural talent"" tag thrust upon her by Indian media and says only hard graft and good coaching have given her the chance to turn the Olympic badminton bronze she won four years ago in London into gold at the Rio Games.""Whatever I am today, it's because of my coaches,"" Nehwal told Reuters in an email interview following her victory at the Australian Open last week.""They taught me smash, dribble and net game in copybook style and I trained five to six hours daily to master them.""I am a worker and my coaches know how to get the best out of me,"" added the 26-year-old, who became the first Indian shuttler to win an Olympic medal in 2012.While winning a medal in London was celebrated back home in success-starved India, her rise to the top of the world singles rankings in April last year was no less significant.It marked the first time a non-Chinese shuttler sat atop the women's singles rankings since Dane Tine Baun in late 2010.Nehwal, who will be 30 by the time the 2020 Olympics come around in Tokyo, believes Rio is her best chance of gold.""For 2020?, it depends on my progress and health conditions.

"LONDON: Mohammad Amir is part of the Pakistan family and will always have the support of his team mates as he prepares to return to Lord's six years after the scandal that derailed his career, fast bowler Wahab Riaz has said.The paceman spent time in jail and served a five-year ban for spot-fixing after admitting he had deliberately bowled no-balls at predetermined times in the fourth test against England at the fabled London venue in 2010.Then 18, Amir was rated among the world's most exciting fast bowlers before the high-profile incident stalled his progress and resulted in similar penalties for fellow accused parties, former test captain Salman Butt and fast bowler Mohammad Asif.The 24-year-old has now returned to the Pakistan setup and the left-arm paceman will be firmly in the spotlight should he be selected for the first test of the four-match series starting at Lord's on July 14.""Obviously he has struggled a lot,"" Wahab told ESPNcricinfo. ""He has learned a lot of things in the past five years, he has become more strong and he wants to answer everyone with his performances, and that's what he's really looking for.Amir's return to the national side was initially resented by some of his team mates but the paceman has enjoyed steady and growing support from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).strong>LIKE A BROTHER</strong""As a team, as a squad of 17 plus our team management, all of us are going to support Mohammad Amir,"" Wahab added.

"HOUSTON: Lionel Messi scored his 55th international goal to become his country's all-time leading scorer as Argentina thrashed hosts the United States 4-0 to ease into the final of the Centenary Copa America on Tuesday.Many of those in the 70,858 crowd in Houston had come to witness the Barcelona star etch his name in the history books and he did not disappoint, curling a sensational free kick past Brad Guzan after 32 minutes to put Argentina 2-0 ahead.Messi had been chopped down by Chris Wondolowski 25 yards from goal as he burst forward and the ensuing strike moved him clear of previous record holder Gabriel Batistuta's 54 goal tally.""I am happy to have surpassed Batistuta's record and I want to thank my team mates, it's theirs as well,"" Messi, who turns 29 on Friday, told reporters.The win, meanwhile, advanced Argentina into Sunday's final against either Colombia or reigning champions Chile, who meet in Chicago on Wednesday.""We needed to get back in a final but we can never get ahead of ourselves,"" Argentine coach Gerardo Martino assed. ""We've always taken it one game at a time.""""We are pleased with our general production (so far).""Martino started Ezequiel Lavezzi up front in place of the injured Angel Di Maria and it took the China-based winger just three minutes to make his mark when he got on the end of a Messi chip to head over a stranded Guzan.strong>GULF IN CLASS</strongArgentina dominated the first half and Messi's goal was just reward for their superiority but if the home side thought they could stage a second-half fightback, they were sadly mistaken.U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann made two changes at the break but Napoli striker Gonzalo Higuain scored a third goal four minutes into the second period when he beat Guzan at the second time of asking after the keeper had saved his initial shot.The U.S. enjoyed more possession as the match progressed but never managed a shot on goal for the entire game as Argentina exposed the gulf in class between the very best South American and North American sides.Messi, who captained the side in his 112th international, almost grabbed a second eight minutes from time but Guzan turned his shot around the post for a corner.However, the mercurial forward was on hand to have a say in the fourth goal, when his pinpoint pass set up Higuain to complete the rout with a simple tap in after 85 minutes.The result means Argentina have scored 18 goals in five games and conceded just two as they power toward what they hope will be their 15th Copa America title, and first since 1993, to take them level with all-time leader Uruguay.The win would also cap Messi's international career after years of disappointment. Argentina reached the finals of their last two tournaments, the Copa America in 2015, and the World Cup in 2014, but were narrowly beaten in both.

"LONDON: Heather Knight had a dream first match as England womens captain starring with both bat and ball in a seven-wicket win over Pakistan in Leicester on Tuesday.Knight, who replaced Charlotte Edwards after the long-serving batsman was effectively forced into retirement by England womens coach Mark Robinson, took five for 26 with her off-spin and then struck an unbeaten 50 as her side cantered to victory with 18.1 overs to spare.It is the first time in 50-over international women's cricket that a player has scored a half-century and taken five wickets in the same match.Chasing 166 to win at the Fischer County Ground in a match originally scheduled for Monday but delayed because of a waterlogged outfield, England cantered home by seven wickets after Kent opener Tammy Beaumont made an international career-best score of 70.She was caught at mid-on in a miscued attempt to hit Asmavia Iqbal's medium pace over midwicket, her only real scare came when she was almost run out on 49, sent back by Knight after setting off for a single.Her partnership with Knight added 96 in 20 overs for the third wicket as England enjoyed the best batting conditions of the day. Nat Sciver then joined Knight, hitting 27 of the 37 more required at the fall of Beaumont's wicket but contriving to allow Knight to complete her half-century before securing the winning single off Iqbal.There was a nervous moment at the start of England's chase when opener Lauren Winfield was caught at slip off the first ball but though Pakistan's captain, the offspinner Sana Mir, bowled Georgia Elwiss for 12, at 53 for 2 from 10 overs England were already on target for a comfortable win.Pakistans 165 all out was built around opener Sidra Ameens 52 but none of her team-mates could offer much in the way of support with the bat.It was a day to remember, too, for strike bowler Katherine Brunt, who became only the fourth England player to take 100 ODI wickets.Pakistan's score was their highest in five one-day internationals against England but would have been regarded as disappointing given the platform provided by opener Sidras maiden ODI half-century.The 24-year-old right-hander from Lahore had made more than half her side's runs off the bat when she was fifth out at 106 in the 32nd over but support was lacking from Pakistan's top and middle order and had it not been for a late show of aggression from Sidra Nawaz and Iqbal then England's task would have been even more straightforward.Asked for bat first on a surface that was predictably sluggish after the wet weather that forced this match to be played in its entirety on the designated reserve day, Pakistan struggled to build early momentum.They crawled to 29 for 1 after 10 overs, the wicket that fell being the one that mattered in particular to Brunt, when Javeria Wadood, tempted by some width, edged the first ball of her fourth over and Amy Jones, keeping wicket for England for the first time in almost two-and-a-half years, held the catch.The result means England move into the top four places in the ICC Women's Championship. If they can maintain that position with eight matches to play they will qualify automatically for the 2017 Women's World Cup, of which they are hosts.England have now won all five of their ODIs against Pakistan and will look to go 2-0 up in three-match series when the teams meet again at Worcester on Wednesday.",6/22/2016,Pak women give up first ODI after Knight shines on debut as captai,cricket,LONDON,Nat;Charlotte;Nawaz;Javeria;Winfield;Katherine;Heather Knight;Asmavia;Mark;Sciver;Amy Jones;Jones;Knight;Sidra Ameens;Lauren Winfield;Brunt;Elwiss;Sidra;Javeria Wadood;Mark Robinson;Tammy;Heather;Charlotte Edwards;Robinson;Lauren;Georgia Elwiss;Ameens;Nat Sciver;Amy;Sidra Nawaz;Asmavia Iqbal;Katherine Brunt;Wadood;Tammy Beaumont;Beaumont;Edwards;Georgia;Iqbal,Pak,ICC
"LENS : Turkey snatched a Euro 2016 lifeline with a 2-0 victory over Czech Republic on Tuesday that secured third place in Group D and left them waiting to see if they had done enough to reach the last 16.After defeats to Croatia and Spain in their first two games, goals by Burak Yilmaz and Ozan Tufan gave the rejuvenated Turks hope, although they need results to go their way when the group stage concludes on Wednesday.Should they go through, Turkey will face either Wales in Paris or hosts France in Lyon.<br/>The Czechs, however, will definitely go home, having finished bottom of the group with one point from three matches.The Turks opened the scoring in the 10th minute when Arda Turan sent Emre Mor scampering away down the right before he crossed for Burak Yilmaz, who ghosted in to send a simple first-time shot from close range flying past Petr Cech.The Czechs almost levelled soon afterwards when Borek Dockal headed against the foot of the post and Tomas Necid could not reach the rebound, before the latter awkwardly volleyed another good chance over 10 minutes later.Although Turkey looked a lot more resilient than they had in their opening two games, they were on the back foot for much of the first half and the Czechs had plenty of chances to score.Full back Pavel Kaderabek missed two great opportunities, firing a shot that Turkey keeper Volkan Babacan saved with his foot before the defender blazed wide following a slick attack down the right.Babacan also pushed a stinging shot from Jaroslav Plasil wide as the Czechs started to find some space on the flanks.Turkey came out all guns blazing in the second half and Emre Mor could have put them two up as he picked up a long ball and drifted in from the right before clipping a shot just over.Yet seconds later Babacan had to make another smart save at the other end from Vladimir Darida.<br/>Moments after Turkey were raging at an offside call that went against them, Ozan Tufan sent thousands of Turkish fans into ecstasy as Mehmet Topal teed him up to smash an unstoppable shot into the topcorner from a tight angle.The goal was greeted by a half-dozen flares lighting up the Turkish end of the ground, with some being thrown onto the pitch during the ear-splitting celebrations.Their spirits lifted by the goal, the Turks battled for every ball in a superb defensive effort, never letting the Czechs settle as they weathered the storm to hold on for a precious victory.",6/22/2016,Turkey beat Czechs to stay in last 16 contenti,football,LENS ,Babacan;Tufan;Darida;Turan;Mehmet;Volkan;Arda Turan;Jaroslav;Borek Dockal;Burak;Arda;Tomas Necid;Burak Yilmaz;Plasil;Emre Mor;Mehmet Topal;Emre;Ozan Tufan;Ozan;Borek;Jaroslav Plasil;Dockal;Mor;Yilmaz;Vladimir Darida;Topal;Pavel Kaderabek;Tomas;Volkan Babacan;Vladimir;Pavel;Kaderabek;Necid,,

"NEW DELHI: Indias ""Magnificent"" Mary Kom said Thursday she was heartbroken after failing to gain a wildcard for the Rio Olympics, but the five-time world champion stressed she wasnt about to quit boxing.Kom, 33, failed to qualify after losing a crucial bout at the Womens World Boxing Championships in Kazakhstan last month, raising speculation about her future.The 2012 Olympic bronze medallist had been pinning her hopes on a last-ditch plea for a wildcard spot, but the International Olympic Committee has now turned down her request.""I have been duly informed that I wont be getting a wildcard. It is heartbreaking,"" Kom was quoted saying by the Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency.""I have to accept this decision but I am not quitting the sport right now. I will continue to compete (while) I am feeling fit and for the time being I think I am fit,"" added Kom.Kom, a household name in India and the subject of a Bollywood film in 2014, always faced an uphill battle to secure a spot.

"Zlatan Ibrahimovic's international career ended in a damp squib when Sweden lost 1-0 to Belgium in their final Euro 2016 Group E match on Wednesday and failed to reach the last 16.Radja Nainggolan's fine shot after 84 minutes sent Belgium into the knockout stages and a game against Hungary as they finished second in the standings, level on six points with group winners Italy.The Swedes ended bottom on one point and Ibrahimovic's bold promise that he would never finish with a disappointment proved to be mistaken.He tried in vain to inspire his team and had a second-half effort ruled out for offside but Belgium, without ever producing their most fluent football, had enough quality to deal with Sweden's sporadic attacks and create opportunities of their own.""Zlatan has done a lot of important things in his career and would have wanted to go further here,"" Belgium captain and man-of-the-match Eden Hazard told reporters.""It was a difficult match, complicated for our defenders. In the first half we had some possession and created chances. Nainggolan scored an important goal and from then on we had to manage the game.""Sweden started brightly and Marcus Berg's fierce snap shot was parried away by Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.Belgium responded with a surging run by midfielder Kevin de Bruyne that set up Romelu Lukaku for a shot just wide and a mazy dribble across the edge of the area by Hazard ended with a De Bruyne strike on goal.Ibrahimovic sprung into life with a shot just past the post but it was a rare attacking foray by Sweden who were pushed back deep by the strong-running Belgian midfield.De Bruyne whipped in two dangerous crosses from the left and from one of them Thomas Meunier flashed a header narrowly wide just before halftime.Sweden enjoyed a good spell of possession after the interval and Ibrahimovic hooked the ball into the net from close range but the effort was ruled out for offside.De Bruyne tested goalkeeper Andreas Isaksson with a fierce long-range strike and after Sweden cleared another dangerous cross the ball fell to midfielder Nainggolan whose rasping 20-metre shot flew into the top corner of the net.Ibrahimovic threw the ball away in frustration as the Belgian players celebrated and Sweden's talismanic captain cut a forlorn figure after the final whistle as he slowly walked over to applaud his team's yellow-clad fans.""Im very disappointed,"" Sweden coach Erik Hamren said.""We were talking before the game about the honour of representing Sweden and of being here but I couldnt have asked for much more from my players.

The game will be a repeat of last year's final in Santiago that the host nation won on penalties.The reigning champions came into the game on a high after beating Mexico 7-0 and took only six minutes to make their mark again.Former Chelsea midfielder Cuadrado misdirected a header across his own goal straight to Charles Aranguiz and the Leverkusen midfielder had the straightforward task of sidefooting past David Ospina.Chile doubled their lead four minutes later after an Alexis Sanchez shot rebounded off the post into the path of Jose Pedro Fuenzalida.With Ospina beaten, the Universidad Catolica full back scored one of the easiest goals of his career by sidefooting into the empty net.Chile, who were already missing midfielders Arturo Vidal and Marcelo Diaz, lost Pedro Pablo Hernandez after half an hour when he limped off injured and the resulting reshuffle took the wind out of their sails.Colombia came back into the game, with James Rodriguez coming close with two shots and creating chances for Roger Martinez and Edwin Carmona.However, Claudio Bravo was in fine form and it stayed 2-0 at the break.Colombia pushed on after the restart with a lively Rodriguez leading the attack but were dealt a huge blow in the 56th minute when influential midfielder Carlos Sanchez was sent off for a second yellow card offence.Colombia did not give up and came close on several occasions but conditions underfoot were difficult for both sides and the score remained 2-0.The Andean side will now play hosts United States in the third-fourth place playoff on Saturday.Argentina beat the United States 4-0 on Tuesday night to reach their second consecutive Copa America final.",6/23/2016,Chile beat Colombia 2 0 to set up final against Argenti,football,Chile,Martinez;Pedro Pablo Hernandez;Edwin;Hernandez;Cuadrado;Juan Cuadrado;Jose Pedro Fuenzalida.With Ospina;Jose;Marcelo;Carmona.However;Roger Martinez;Ospina.Chile;Pablo;Roger;Charles;Alexis;James;Claudio Bravo;Ospina;Arturo;Alexis Sanchez;Arturo Vidal;Aranguiz;Edwin Carmona.However;Fuenzalida.With;David Ospina.Chile;Vidal;Claudio;David;Pedro;Juan;Charles Aranguiz;James Rodriguez;Rodriguez;Sanchez;Marcelo Diaz;Bravo;Carlos Sanchez;Carlos;Diaz,Argenti,Chelsea;Leverkusen;Universidad Catolica
"England captain Wayne Rooney has set his sights on winning the European Championship, buoyed by the belief that the gap between his team and Europe's continental footballing elite has narrowed considerably in the past few years.Monday's 0-0 draw with Slovakia ensured that England finished second in Group B behind Wales, potentially complicating their route to the final as they are now in the same side of the draw as World Cup winners Germany, defending European champions Spain and hosts France.English FA chairman Greg Dyke had said before the tournament that making the semi-finals or being eliminated at the quarter-final stage by ""a good team"" would be considered a success, but Rooney has set his sights considerably higher.""We are here and we want to win it,"" England's all-time leading goalscorer told reporters.""Whether it happens remains to be seen, but we're not going to say that getting to the quarter finals will be a sign of progress. I believe we are better than that.""England have not got past the quarter-finals in their last three European Championships and failed to make it out of the group stage at the World Cup in 2014, but Rooney sees cause for optimism this time round.""If this was four years ago and you were saying you have to play France, Spain and Germany you would have been worried,"" he added.""I think the gap has changed, and not just with ourselves, but with the likes of Wales.

"BIRMINGHAM: Sri Lanka were left sweating on the fitness of captain Angelo Mathews for the second one-day international against England after the allrounder was rated 70 percent following Thursday s practice session.Fridays match at Edgbaston is a day night clash, starting at 1300 GMT so the tourists do have a little extra time in which key allrounder Mathews can demonstrate he has recovered fully from a hamstring strain.The injury meant Mathews was off the field when England tailender Liam Plunkett struck the last ball of the match for six to seal a spectacular tie in Tuesdays opening contest of a fivematch series at Trent Bridge.By that stage, Mathews had already underlined his worth to Sri Lanka by topscoring with 73 in a total of 286 for nine and then taking two early wickets with his medium pace as England collapsed to 30 for four and 82 for six.If he is sidelined on Friday, off-spinner Suraj Randiv is likely to come into the team with wicketkeeper Dinesh Chandimal taking over as captain.Mathews took no part in the squad s full practice session at Edgbaston in Birmingham central England on Thursday but did some stretching before being able to run at an estimated 70 percent by a team spokesman and then putting his pads on to face a tennis ball on the outfield.Earlier opener Danushka Gunathilaka emphasised Mathews s importance to Sri Lanka by saying He s the key man in the middle order for us and he played a brilliant knock (at Trent Bridge).Hes very important for our next four matches and we hope he will get well soon and play the next one.Gunathilaka set to win his 10th ODI cap on Friday said Mathews s advice had been helpful in his fledgling international career.He gave me a lot of confidence  thats been really helpful to me he said.Gunathilaka managed only nine at Nottinghams Trent Bridge on Tuesday before being caught behind off leftarm paceman David Willey.",6/24/2016,Sri Lankas Mathews doubtful for 2nd ODI,tennis,BIRMINGHAM,Mathews;Gunathilaka;David Willey;Liam Plunkett;Suraj Randiv;Randiv;Chandimal;Angelo;Danushka;Plunkett;Willey;Liam;Angelo Mathews;Suraj;Dinesh Chandimal;Dinesh;David;Danushka Gunathilaka,Sri Lankas Mathews,
"MUMBAI: A force to be reckoned with at home, India's test side have struggled away from the subcontinent in recent years and new skipper Anil Kumble has put top priority on building a team that can travel with confidence.Kumble, India's most successful bowler, was given a one-year term as head coach on Thursday with the country's cricket board (BCCI) putting their faith in the 45-year-old despite his lack of coaching experience.The BCCI received 57 applications for the job, which were then made available to an advisory panel that included former captains Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly and former batsman VVS Laxman -- all of whom have played with Kumble.Kumble's coaching experience has been limited to being a mentor to the Mumbai and Bangalore teams in the Indian Premier League T20 tournament, and he said his first job interview was a ""nerve-racking"" experience.""It was very different because this was the first (job) interview that I was attending,"" Kumble said. ""My colleagues who I have played with throughout my career were on the other side of the table.""It was very strange. It was quite nerve-racking.""While the Indian team under Virat Kohli won test series in Sri Lanka and beat South Africa 3-0 at home, their record outside the subcontinent in the longest format has been poor.They have lost test series in South Africa, New Zealand, England and Australia on tours since late 2013, something Kumble wants to rectify.""The focus will be on our overseas record,"" Kumble told the board's website (www.bcci.tv). ""The mindset ...

"LYON: Having squeezed into the Euro 2016 knockout stages after three contrasting group stage draws, Portugal are ready to move up a gear when they face Croatia in their mouth-watering last-16 clash in Lens on Saturday, coach Fernando Santos said.While the Croatians romped into the tournament's business end with a 2-1 win over holders Spain, the Portuguese came from behind three times in Wednesday's rip-roaring 3-3 draw against Hungary at Parc OL.Their talismanic forward Cristiano Ronaldo, subdued in the 1-1 tie with Iceland and a goalless stalemate against Austria, rediscovered his scoring touch with two fine second-half goals which saved Portugal from an early exit.Santos was confident that Ronaldo, who became the first player to score in four European championships, would thrive as Portugal aim to win ""a series of finals"" on the road to what would be their maiden title.""Ronaldo is a scorer and a winner, he plays up front and feeds on goals,"" Santos said after the Real Madrid hitman was voted man of the match against the Hungarians.""I am sure this performance will boost his confidence in our bid to win the competition.""Everything is different now because every game that follows is like a final, there is no room for error. We want to come out on top in all of them and go all the way.""""We have to strike the right balance between defence and attack because when we come forward we leave too many gaps at the back, as our group stage results show.""The Croatians, who came from behind to beat Spain with a makeshift team, left their coach Ante Cacic spoilt for choice after reserve striker Nikola Kalinic and several other fringe players shone.Kalinic enjoyed a rare start instead of the towering Mario Mandzukic and repaid the faith with a sublime equaliser before Ivan Perisic netted a late winner.""We could have done with easier opposition than Portugal in the last 16 but if we play like we did in the group stage, we have a great chance of progressing,"" Kalinic told a news conference at Croatia's Deauville base.""We are one of the best teams here and if our midfield wins the battle in the centre of the pitch, we should win.""""This is the present generation's chance of a lifetime and we will only be remembered if we do something big here.""",6/24/2016,Preview Portugal braced for series of finals says S,football,LYON,Ante;Cacic;Perisic;Ronaldo;Nikola;Mandzukic;Cristiano Ronaldo;Kalinic;Ivan Perisic;Mario;Nikola Kalinic;Fernando Santos;Santos;Fernando;Ivan;Mario Mandzukic;Cristiano;Ante Cacic,,Real Madrid

"Novak Djokovic's vice-like grip on grand slam silverware will be put to the test at Wimbledon next week but such is the world number one's dominance few look capable of loosening it.The insatiable Serb's stunning level of consistency has left his rivals running out of ideas at how to stop him and made real the possibility that the 29-year-old could even threaten Roger Federer's record total of 17 grand slam titles.In Paris earlier this month he became the first player since Jim Courier in 1992 to win the year's first two majors -- swatting away chief rival Andy Murray in ruthless fashion.It also completed his career slam, took him to equal fourth on the all-time list with 12 majors and means he holds all four of the game's most cherished trophies at the same time.What is more he has not lost at Wimbledon since Murray beat him in the 2013 final and has has appeared in eight of the last nine title matches in the slams, winning six of them.""Everyone is chasing Djokovic, there's no question about it,"" three-times Wimbledon winner John McEnroe said this week looking ahead to Djokovic's attempted defence of the crown.""At the majors, if you look at his records, he's approaching Roger's records, which would seem insurmountable. It's amazing.""With seven-times Wimbledon champion Federer finally starting to succumb to injuries at the age of 34, he missed the French Open after 65 consecutive majors, his chances of snatching back the trophy from Djokovic seem to be receding.Although writing him off a year after his mesmerising semi-final defeat of Murray would be foolhardy.Rafael Nadal is missing with a wrist injury, which leaves Murray as the main threat, especially now he has Ivan Lendl back in his coaching corner -- the man who guided the Scot to his two victories in grand slam finals, both against Djokovic.World number two Murray warmed up with a fifth title at Queen's Club where he beat Canada's Milos Raonic in the final.McEnroe, who is working with men's sixth seed Raonic at Wimbledon got a close-hand view of Murray at Queen's and was impressed with what he saw.""Murray is playing great. He's obviously put himself in position numerous times,"" McEnroe said. ""But at the moment there's no question that the level that Novak is at is something that you rarely, if ever, see.""With McEnroe in Raonic's box, eight-times major champion Lendl working with Murray again, Boris Becker plotting for Djokovic and now Richard Krajicek fine-tuning Stan Wawrinka's grasscourt game, the battle of the super-coaches looks like being as compelling as the on-court action.Wawrinka, seeded four at Wimbledon, has never been past the quarter-finals at the All England Club, but has proved previously that he can beat Djokovic -- as has Japan's Kei Nishikori who will be seeded five.While Djokovic stands in a league of his own and Murray is positioned ahead of the pack, there are signs that a new generation could soon be breaking up the status quo.Austrian Dominic Thiem, a French Open semi-finalist and winner on grass in Stuttgart where he beat Federer recently, will be seeded eighth while Australian Nick Kyrgios, quarter-finalist two years ago, will be dangerous at 15.Germany's Alex Zverev also beat Federer in Halle last week.""Thiem, Zverev, these guys can see light at the end of the tunnel.It's an exciting time for men's tennis,"" McEnroe said.",6/24/2016,Insatiable Djokovic hunting fourth Wimbledon cr,tennis,,Federer;Nishikori;John;Jim Courier;Kyrgios;Ivan;Boris Becker;Alex;Nadal;Becker;Nick;Kei;Roger Federer;Nick Kyrgios;Zverev;Krajicek;Andy;Alex Zverev;McEnroe;Stan;Murray;Wawrinka;Richard;Boris;Courier;Milos Raonic;Novak;Roger;Andy Murray;John McEnroe;Ivan Lendl;Dominic;Lendl;Djokovic;Kei Nishikori;Thiem;Jim;Raonic;Richard Krajicek;Dominic Thiem;Novak Djokovic;Milos;Stan Wawrinka,Djokovic;Novak Djokovic,Wimbledon;All England Club;Queen's Club

"NEW JERSEY: Chile face Argentina in Sunday's Copa America final for the right to call themselves South America's dominant team but perhaps an even bigger question for football fans the world over regards whether Lionel Messi can finally win a major international title.The Barcelona forward has won every trophy possible with the Spanish club but he has lost three finals with Argentina, including in 2014 World Cup Final in 2014 and the Copa America last year.Sunday's game against Chile in New Jersey gives Messi a chance to end both his personal hoodoo and that of Argentina, who have not won a major title since lifting the Copa America in Ecuador in 1993.""Getting to three finals in a row is impressive,"" said Messi, whose first decider was a 3-0 loss to Brazil in the 2007 Copa America. ""I hope we can win the Cup that we so desire.""Argentina lost to Chile on penalties in the final last year and Messi said the squad were better prepared this time around.""You learn all the time,"" said Messi, who turned 29 on Friday.""We have been working together for another year, we are stronger as a group and we've really grown in a lot of ways.""The five-times world player of the year has been outstanding at the Centenary Copa America, even though he played the first three games as a substitute after injuring his back in a warm-up game.His sublime free kick in the 4-0 win over the United States took him on to 55 goals and above Gabriel Batistuta as Argentina's all-time leading goalscorer.Messi called the performance against the U.S. ""perfect"" and he will not have forgotten that Argentina beat Chile 2-1 in their opening match on June 6.RED HOT CHILEHowever, the Chileans have improved since, beating Bolivia and Panama before hammering Mexico 7-0 in what was undoubtedly the performance of the tournament.Coach Juan Antonio Pizzi, who replaced Jorge Sampaoli in January, is now settled in the job and he has Chile playing the same high-paced pressing and super-fast counter attacks that make them such an exciting team to watch.""This team has created an identity,"" the Argentine-born Pizzi said after the semi-final.""It's a group of winners, I can see that just talking with them. That's not because they win games because we don't win every time but in their heads they are convinced they are going to win. That mentality allows them to grow stronger and gives them the confidence to keep going.""Chile will have the dynamic Artur Vidal back after suspension and Pizzi hopes central midfielder Marcelo Diaz will recover from the muscle injury that kept him out the 2-0 win over Colombia in the semi-final.They are on a high and confident that they will do the double over their neighbours.But they will not have their home fans behind them this time and there is one other detail. The last time Messi played at the MetLife stadium was also in June and also against a South American side.Argentina beat Brazil 4-3 in a friendly in 2012.

"BIRMINGHAM: An England record opening partnership of 256 between Alex Hales and Jason Roy led their side to a crushing 10-wicket win over Sri Lanka in the second one-day international in Birmingham on Friday.Hales scored 133 not out and Roy an unbeaten 112 in Englands highest first-wicket partnership in one-day cricket and they overhauled Sri Lankas 254 for seven with more than 15 overs to spare.It is just the sixth such victory England have achieved in their ODI history and the highest score against which any side has achieved it. It is the fifth time Sri Lanka have been defeated by ten wickets in an ODI.Their stand was not only a record for England's opening pair - overhauling Vikram Solanki and Marcus Tresocthick's 200 partnership against South Africa in 2003 - but the highest for any wicket in ODIs by England batsmen. Previously, Andrew Strauss and Jonathan Trott - who put on 250 together against Bangladesh here in 2010 - held the record.England lead the five-match series 1-0 after the first match in Nottingham was tied.Sri Lanka opted to bat after winning the toss but their total always looked inadequate on a good batting pitch at Edgbaston as England took wickets at regular intervals.Dinesh Chandimal and Angelo Mathews shared a fourth-wicket stand of 82 to give their side a platform.Mathews fell for 44, however, and Chandimal was run out for 52 by Roy who had earlier produced a brilliant piece of fielding to run out Kusal Perera.Upul Tharanga struck an unbeaten 53 to give Sri Lanka hope but Englands bowlers maintained a tight grip throughout, leg-spinner Adil Rasheed the pick of the attack with figures of 2-34 from 10 overs.Hales and man-of-the-match Roy were completely in command against a toothless Sri Lanka attack.Hales smashed six sixes and 10 fours while Roy went to his second one-day international century with his fourth six before driving Seekkuge Prasanna to the cover boundary to seal victory.The third match of the series is in Bristol on Sunday.",6/25/2016,Hales and Roy power England to record breaking ten wicket wi,cricket,BIRMINGHAM,Mathews;Tresocthick;Andrew Strauss;Trott;Hales;Chandimal;Jonathan Trott;Angelo;Angelo Mathews;Solanki;Jonathan;Marcus Tresocthick;Prasanna;Jason;Vikram;Alex;Vikram Solanki;Seekkuge Prasanna;Andrew;Seekkuge;Rasheed;Strauss;Marcus;Alex Hales;Jason Roy;Adil Rasheed;Adil;Roy,Hales;Roy;Alex Hales;Jason Roy,
"BRIDGETOWN, Barbados: Darren Bravos third hundred and impressive fast bowling from Shannon Gabriel propelled the West Indies to a comprehensive 100-run victory over South Africa in the ninth and final preliminary match of the Tri-Nation One-Day International Series at Kensington Oval in Barbados on Friday.Bravos stroke-filled 102 anchored an impressive recovery from 21 for four to lift the West Indies to 285 all out off 49.5 overs batting first.Gabriel, in just his second ODI, then tore through the Proteas vaunted top-order, taking the wickets of Quinton de Kock, Faf du Plessis and captain A.B. de Villiers in the space of four fearsome overs.It was a setback from which they never recovered, eventually being dismissed for 186 off 46 overs despite a last-wicket partnership of 51 between Morne Morkel and Imran Tahir. Sunil Narine ensured there would be no escape for the South Africans after Gabriels early blast, the spinner taking three for 28 off ten overs.With their second win in three matches against the Proteas in the tournament, the hosts advance to face World Cup-holders Australia in the final on Sunday at the same venue. It is also the first time in ten years that South Africa have failed to reach the final of a tri-nation ODI series.Of concern for the West Indies looking ahead to the final though will be the fitness of Gabriel, who left the field nursing a right leg injury after claiming the impressive figures of three for 17 from five overs of extreme pace. He should have also snared the wicket of Hashim Amla but wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin missed the straightforward opportunity offered by the prolific opener.West Indies were themselves rocked back at 21 for four when pacer Kagiso Rabada led the assault after de Villiers chose to field. However Bravos third one-day century, embellished with 12 fours and four sixes off 103 deliveries, proved invaluable. He found an able partner in Kieron Pollard, who curbed his usual all-out aggression in compiling 62 off 71 balls.Their fifth-wicket stand of 156 was a new West Indian record for the wicket against South Africa and wrested the initiative from the visitors who did not help their cause with characteristically untidy cricket in the field, fast-medium bowler Morne Morkel delivering six of the 17 wides conceded by the Proteas.Morkels nine overs cost 68 runs yet for all that indiscipline, he should have still claimed the important wicket early on of Bravo who, on 11, top-edged an attempted hook only for Wayne Parnell to misjudge the catch at fine-leg and parry the ball over the boundary rope.Imran Tahir, who routed the West Indies in their last meeting in St Kitts with record-breaking figures of seven for 45, was kept wicketless through his ten overs for the first time in ODI cricket against these opponents.South Africas bowling star without doubt was Rabada, whose returns of three for 31 were highlighted by a devastating opening burst after Parnell had removed Andre Fletcher in his opening over.Generating tremendous pace, Rabada induced an edge from the other opener, Johnson Charles, for Chris Morris to take a comfortable catch at second slip. He then uprooted Marlon Samuels off-stump first ball to have the West Indies tottering at 12 for three.Ramdin avoided the hat-trick but subsequently succumbed to the lethal hostility of the 21-year-old fast bowler, first ducking into a short ball to take a blow on the back of the helmet before being comprehensively bowled off the next delivery.Bravo and Pollard then countered the rampant South Africans with determination and forceful strokeplay before the big-hitting all-rounder was caught at long-on off the suffering Morkel.Morris claimed three wickets at the end of the innings with West Indies captain Jason Holder (40) and Carlos Brathwaite (33 not out) pushing the home side to a challenging final total.",6/25/2016,West Indies topple South Africa in Tri nation seri,cricket,BRIDGETOWN,de;Sunil;Parnell;Wayne Parnell;Shannon;Shannon Gabriel;du;Darren;Pollard;Chris;Morris;Jason;Denesh;Charles;Narine;Chris Morris;Tahir;Quinton;Wayne;Samuels;Kieron Pollard;Kagiso;Kieron;Rabada;Marlon Samuels;Hashim;Gabriel;Ramdin;Marlon;Imran Tahir;Johnson Charles;Quinton de Kock;Denesh Ramdin;A.B. de Villiers;Brathwaite;Kock;Plessis;Faf du Plessis;Morkel;Morne;Kagiso Rabada;Sunil Narine;Bravos;Amla;Hashim Amla;Andre Fletcher;Johnson;Darren Bravos;A.B.;Holder;Faf;Imran;Andre;Jason Holder;Villiers;Morne Morkel;Fletcher;Carlos Brathwaite;Carlos,,St Kitts;West Indies

"LONDON: On court Novak Djokovic is taking tennis to extraordinary new levels with his single-minded obsession with winning; off it the Serbian is more than happy to share power.The 29-year-old will begin his attempt to win a fourth Wimbledon title on Monday when he plays British wildcard James Ward on Centre Court -- 12 months after claiming a second successive title by beating Roger Federer.While nothing will distract him from that goal, the dominant Serbian also knows that, however big the gap is between himself and his rivals -- and it is a yawning chasm -- no player is bigger than the sport.At his pre-tournament news conference at Wimbledon on Sunday, the world number one confirmed he had re-joined the 12-man ATP Players' Council, along with chief rival Andy Murray and Murray's brother Jamie, the world's top doubles player.It is a responsibility Djokovic will apply himself to with the same devotion as his career for the next two years as tennis wrestles with the kind of doping and corruption scandals that have afflicted world sport.""I've been very flattered and humbled to be elected by my colleagues,"" Djokovic told reporters.""The way I see it is that I managed to gain trust from players, which is very important to me. I have been part of the Player Council for three years earlier in my career.I've been familiar with the way the system works.""I'm hoping I can contribute to the evolution and to the betterment of our sport in every aspect.""There is little argument that he has taken tennis to new levels of perfection since losing to Murray in the 2013 final here.Since then he has won six of the 11 grand slam titles on offer, taking his tally to 12 overall.In beating Murray at Roland Garros earlier this month he became the first man in 47 years to hold all four majors.He also won the ATP World Tour Finals in November and will have his eye on Olympic gold in August and probably the Davis Cup too.His immediate focus though is on a smooth opening to his Wimbledon campaign having chosen again not to play any grasscourt tournaments in the run-up.""This year is quite different from previous years because I'm coming in with a Roland Garros title,"" he said.""That gives me, obviously, a lot of confidence. I've played a lot of points in the practice sessions these four or five days, trying to be on the grass as much as I can. So I'm really keen on getting on the court.""Djokovic, who beat Federer in the last two Wimbledon finals, could face a tough path to a hat-trick.Big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic is a potential quarter-final opponent with Federer possible in the semis.Ward is unlikely to pose too many problems, although Djokovic is well aware that the crowd will be rooting for his opponent when play begins on Monday.""It's going to be the first match on the untouched grass,"" he said. "" That's probably one of the most special tennis matches that you get to experience as a tennis player.""I'm looking forward to that.Obviously I know that he doesn't have much to lose.""",6/26/2016,Djokovic focused on Wimbledon defence but sees bigger pictur,tennis,LONDON,Federer;Murray;Roland Garros;Jamie;Milos Raonic;James Ward;Novak;Roger;Andy Murray;James;Djokovic;Roger Federer.While;Garros;Federer.While;Raonic;Roland;Ward;Novak Djokovic;Milos;Andy,Djokovic;Novak Djokovic,Roland Garros;Centre Court;Wimbledon;ATP Players' Council;Player Council
"LYON: Hosts France came from behind to beat 10-man Ireland 2-1 and reach the Euro 2016 quarter-finals after two second-half strikes from forward Antoine Griezmann at Parc OL on Sunday.A tactical switch from coach Didier Deschamps at the break revitalised the French, who struggled to find their feet early on after conceding a Robbie Brady penalty in the second minute, the fastest goal in the 2016 tournament.France will play either England or Iceland at the Stade de France next Sunday.""We have difficulties getting into games, we saw that again today, and that's something we have to work on,"" said Griezmann.""Finding ourselves trailing made it difficult but we showed we've got heart. Things were said in the dressing room at halftime and in the second half, it was a different France team.""It was the worst possible start for the hosts when midfielder Paul Pogba clumsily barged over Ireland's Shane Long in the penalty area, allowing Brady to dispatch the resulting spot kick to go 1-0 up on the second minute.Finding themselves behind for the first time in the tournament, the hosts seemed to lack the urgency to wrestle control of a stop-start first half.Their best chances fell to Griezmann who headed over the bar from close range, while a late strike by Dimitri Payet whacked into the Irish defence who desperately guarded their goal.strong>SURGING RUN</strongAt the other end, Ireland didn't really threaten apart from a bouncing shot from striker Daryl Murphy that forced keeper Hugo Lloris to dive to his left.A flat first half ended with the French players trudging off to the noise of loud booing from the packed home support.Deschamps switched things up after the break, bringing on flying winger Kingsley Coman for holding midfielder N'Golo Kante and moving playmaker Pogba into the middle and Griezmann into a more central role behind strike partner Olivier Giroud.The strategy paid dividends immediately as France stretched a tiring Ireland. Griezmann equalised in the 58th minute from a Bacary Sagna cross, and then fired his team in front three minutes later when Giroud nodded the ball down into his path.Another surging run from Griezmann saw him chopped down on the edge of the area by Shane Duffy, earning the defender a red card as the game started to look beyond the Irish.All was forgiven by the French crowd, who broke into a deafening 'Marseillaise' and cheered their team all the way to their first knockout stage win in the competition since winning Euro 2000.On a bum note, though, Kante and defender Adil Rami picked up yellow cards and will miss the quarter final through suspension.",6/26/2016,Griezmann double sends France into Euro 2016 last eig,football,LYON,Shane;Dimitri;Paul Pogba;Rami;Robbie;Brady;N'Golo Kante;Didier;Antoine;Robbie Brady;Murphy;Duffy;Adil Rami;Payet;Daryl;Kingsley Coman;Coman;Giroud;Antoine Griezmann;Olivier Giroud.The;Dimitri Payet;Hugo Lloris;Griezmann;Giroud.The;Long;Adil;Lloris;Didier Deschamps;Deschamps;Shane Long;N'Golo;Paul;Daryl Murphy;Shane Duffy;Kante;Hugo;Kingsley;Olivier;Pogba,Griezmann;Antoine Griezmann,

"NEW YORK: Keith Thurman put his stamp on the deeply talented welterweight division Saturday, beating challenger Shawn Porter by a unanimous decision to retain his World Boxing Association title.Thurman kept his undefeated record alive and showed he deserves to be regarded as the kingpin of the welterweight division, which is moving on from the retirements of Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao.The 27-year-old Thurman landed several solid lefts that either wobbled or staggered Porter as he won the close contest at the Barclays Center arena in New York by scores of 115-113 on all three judges scorecards.<br/> ""Defense, defense, defense,"" said Thurman who improved to 27-0 with 22 knockouts.The clash between two Americans was supposed to be held earlier this year, but Thurman was involved in a car crash on a rain-slicked Florida street which pushed the bout back three months.Thurman, who has been on fringes of boxing celebrity, is hoping this is a breakthrough moment for him as the former champion Porter proved to be the biggest test of his career to date.Former IBF welterweight champ Porter lost the first 12-round fight of his career.Porter figured he had done enough to wrestle the title away and some in the crowd agreed with him, booing the scores when they were announced <br/> ""I thought I won the fight. But I am satisfied because the competitor came out.

"Paris: Giorgio Chiellini and Graziano Pelle scored the goals as Italy exacted revenge for their Euro 2012 final hammering by dumping Spain out of Euro 2016 with a deserved 2-0 last 16 win in Paris on Monday.Chiellini forced home the winner from close range after goalkeeper David de Gea could only parry Eders fiercely struck free-kick. Pelle volleyed in a deflected cross in injury time to complete Spains heartbreak.After crashing out of the World Cup in the first round, Vicente del Bosques team have now failed to get to the Euro quarter finals.A series of De Gea saves kept Spain in the game, but their quest for an unprecedented third consecutive Euro title peetered out as Gianluigi Buffon saved from Andres Iniesta and Gerard Pique late on to set up a mouthwatering quarter-final clash with Germany on Saturday in Bordeaux.Spain had lost just one of their previous 11 meetings with Italy, including a 4-0 win in the Euro 2012 final. But the Azzurri were by far the better side in the opening 45 minutes and could have been more than one goal up at the break.De Gea had been much-criticised for his performance as Spains 15-game unbeaten in the Euros came to an end on Tuesday with a 2-1 defeat to Croatia which cost them top spot in Group D.However, the Manchester United stopper more than made amends when he turned Pelles bullet header wide on eight minutes.Emanuele Giaccherinis acrobatic effort was then turned onto the post by De Gea, albeit referee Cuneyt Cakir had already blown for a foul as Italy continued to dominate the early exchanges.It took Spain 28 minutes to even have an effort on goal as Iniestas weak shot was straight at Buffon.Antonio Contes side finally made the breakthrough 12 minutes before half-time when Spain captain Sergio Ramos unncessarily dived in on Pelle to concede a free-kick on the edge of the box.Eders powerful effort was parried by De Gea only as far as Giaccherini and he nudged the ball into Chiellinis path to bundle home.strong>- Saving grace -</strongOnly a De Gea wonder save to tip a fiercely dipping drive from Giaccherini over kept Spain in the game before half-time.Spain coach Vicente del Bosque introduced the more physical presence of 35-year-old striker Aritz Aduriz for Nolito at the break.And it nearly paid dividends straight away as Alvaro Morata -- kept quiet in the first 45 minutes by former Juventus teammates Chiellini, Andrea Barzagli and Leonardo Bonucci -- headed a golden chance straight at Buffon.De Gea was called upon once more to block from Eder when the Brazilian-born Inter Milan forward burst clear on goal with the chance to double Italys advantage.Another Italy counter-attack then caused chaos in the Spanish defence as Mattia de Sciglios low cross ricocheted around the box before being cleared.Aduriz swept the ball wide and Ramos headed over from a corner as Italy began to settle on their one-goal lead in the final quarter.Iniestas rasping volley was tipped over by Buffon, before Piques long-range effort stung the palms of the 38-year-old.However, with Aduriz having to be replaced by Pedro Rodriguez due to a head knock, Spain didnt have a recognised striker in their search for an equaliser in the final 10 minutes.Italy comfortably held on and Pelle doubled the lead with his poachers strike in the first minute of injury time.",6/27/2016,Italy dump Spain out of Euro 2016,football,Paris,de;Sergio Ramos;Pelles;del;De Gea;Iniesta;Eder;Giorgio;Pique;David de Gea;Bonucci;Mattia de Sciglios;Leonardo Bonucci;De;Andres;Gea;Pelle;Morata;Bosque;Andrea Barzagli;Graziano;David;Sciglios;Pedro Rodriguez;Rodriguez;Aritz Aduriz;Barzagli;Mattia;Andres Iniesta;Cakir;Gerard Pique;Vicente del Bosque;Graziano Pelle;Buffon;Ramos;Cuneyt Cakir;Giorgio Chiellini;Cuneyt;Andrea;Leonardo;Gianluigi;Alvaro Morata;Alvaro;Sergio;Chiellini;Vicente;Aduriz;Gianluigi Buffon;Gerard;Aritz;Giaccherini;Pedro,,Juventus;Azzurri;Inter Milan;Manchester United;Vicente del Bosques

Amir is all set to play the first Test match at Lords.We all know about the circumstances surrounding his return but he is mentally prepared for this tour and he will be able to handle himself well, he told Pakpassion.net.He said this is not the first time Amir is touring a foreign country after returning to international cricket and he also has been to England before.The Pakistan fast bowling attack apart from Amir and Wahab Riaz is inexperienced but Intikhab said it could provide a few shocks to the opposition.There is no doubt that our pace attack lacks the kind of experience that has been the hallmark of previous visiting Pakistan sides but I would caution against under estimating their capabilities.They have all been bowling well in recent times and are physically fit and will provide a sterntest for the England batsmen, he said.Speaking about the new head coach he said we are very fortunate to have someone of the stature of Mickey Arthur as Head Coach for Pakistan.He is working very hard with the team and the players are responding nicely and enthusiastically to his advice and comments.We will prepare well and put in the effort needed and God willing when the time comes make the nation proud of this team, he said.",6/27/2016,Mohammad Amir first Test Lords England Intikhab A,cricket,ISLAMABAD,Mickey;Mohammad Amir;Arthur;Alam;Wahab;Amir;Mickey Arthur;Mohammad;Wahab Riaz;Pakpassion.net.He;Riaz;Intikhab;Intikhab Alam,Mohammad Amir,Amirs
"BRIDGETOWN, Barbados: Australia, the world's top-ranked one-day-international side, need to work on a number of aspects to improve ahead of next year's Champions Trophy, captain Steve Smith said after they won a triangular series win in the West Indies.All-rounder Mitchell Marsh's bowling and wicketkeeper Matthew Wade's lower middle order batting powered Australia to a 58-run win against hosts West Indies in the final of the tournament, which also included South Africa.""I was pleased with the way we scrapped today,"" Smith told reporters after the victory in Barbados. ""I am using that word a lot. But that's been bit of a theme in this series with the kind of wickets we have been playing on.""I am pleased we were able to get the job done.""The Champions Trophy, featuring the top eight teams in the world, will be held next June in England and Wales where Australia have been grouped with the hosts, New Zealand and Bangladesh.In Sunday's final, West Indies made a brisk start in their chase of 271 with a 49-run opening stand between Johnson Charles and Andre Fletcher before Australia wrested back control and Smith said his bowlers need to start better with the new ball.""""We have to continue to start well with the ball,"" the 27-year-old said.

"BRISTOL: Fifties to Kusal Mendis, Dinesh Chandimal and Angelo Mathews were the sparks in a Sri Lanka score of 248 for 9, but gloom ultimately defined the day, after rain washed out play four overs into the reply. The back end of Sri Lanka's innings had been played in drizzle, which persisted through the lunch break and for some time afterwards. Although the weather relented to allow the teams to resume play, it returned at about 4pm and play was called off by 5.30pm. England had lost Alex Hales, for a golden duck, and were 16 for 1.In Bristol, just like in the first two games, partnerships were severed by canny quicks whenever the visitors threatened to assume control of the match. In the ten overs following the 35th, Sri Lanka lost four wickets for 40 runs, and squandered the base their half-centurions had provided.Liam Plunkett and Chris Woakes claimed three scalps apiece, the former more effective with the new ball, the latter quite good with the old.Mendis batted as he has through the tour. He bludgeoned two Chris Jordan short balls for four and six at the end of the 18th over. Next over, Mendis completed a second ODI fifty with the 78th run of the innings, but then his panache forged his downfall. Attempting to repeat his pulled six against a taller, faster Plunkett, Mendis managed only to put the ball in the palms of deep square leg.Chandimal assumed a more positive outlook as he and Mathews manoeuvred Sri Lanka away from 88 for 3. Mathews ventured a low, straight six off Plunkett in the 26th over, but Adil Rashid's legspin was the more frequent victim of the pair's belligerence. The seamers returned the pair to a more measured approach, though they did continue to score smartly enough, relative to the situation: their 80-run stand was the heftiest in Sri Lanka's innings, and came off 87 balls.Having set themselves up at a reasonable 165 for 3 after 35 overs, the following ten overs were a period of significant decline. Chandimal, then Seekkuge Prasanna, were out in consecutive overs, both caught aiming swipes across the line. Mathews moved to his second half-century in three games in the company of Upul Tharanga, but top-edged a leg-side heave off Jordan to depart for 56 off 67 in the 44th over. Though the match situation was well-poised for Dasun Shanaka to showcase his hitting range, yet he attempted a non-existent single to short third man, and found himself run out cheaply again, by a sharp Joe Root.Tharanga then made the best of having to bat with the tail. He cobbled together a 33-ball 40, while Woakes in particular bowled expertly to his field, at the death. He took out the top of Tharanga's middle stump with his final ball, before Sri Lanka's last-wicket pair swung optimistically through the final over.",6/27/2016,England restrict subdued Sri Lanka before washou,cricket,BRISTOL,Mathews;Kusal;Chris Woakes;Hales;Rashid;Chandimal;Angelo;Kusal Mendis;Angelo Mathews;Chris;Prasanna;Root.Tharanga;Dasun Shanaka;Jordan;Alex;Joe;Dasun;Seekkuge Prasanna;Seekkuge;Plunkett;Tharanga;Adil Rashid;Woakes;Shanaka;Dinesh Chandimal;Dinesh;Alex Hales;Adil;Joe Root.Tharanga;Chris Jordan;Mendis,,
"BRIDGETOWN, Barbados: A match-winning three-wicket bowling stint by Mitchell Marsh lifted Australia to a convincing victory by 58 runs against West Indies in the final of the triangular one-day international (ODI) series in Barbados on Sunday.Australia, who batted first after winning the toss, seemed destined to post a middling target until wicketkeeper Matthew Wade, batting at number seven, rattled off an unbeaten 57 off 52 balls.He finished his stint at the crease in style with a towering six over mid wicket off the final ball as the visitors scored 270 for nine from their allotted 50 overs.The Windies made a breezy start in reply as openers Johnson Charles and Andre Fletcher put on a quick 49, with Charles scoring the lions share of the runs at Kensington Oval in Bridgetown.But the floodgates opened after Fletcher (9) was caught at slip off paceman Josh Hazlewood, as medium-pacer Marsh collected three quick wickets to turn the match decisively and inexorably in Australias direction.Marsh dismissed Darren Bravo (6) and Marlon Samuels (6) cheaply, before trapping Charles (45) plum leg-before-wicket to leave the Windies staggering at 72 for four.Marsh finished with 3-32 off 10 miserly overs, while Hazlewood (5-50) mopped up the tail as the home team were all out for 212 after 48.4 overs.The result cements Australias number one ODI ranking, while eighth-ranked West Indies might take some consolation from reaching the final ahead of South Africa, the other team in the 10-match series.Hazlewood was named man of the series for his 11-wicket haul.Next up for West Indies is a four-Test home series against India starting on July 21, while Australia start a three-Test series in Sri Lanka on July 26.",6/27/2016,Australia beat West Indies to claim tri nation seri,cricket,BRIDGETOWN,Wade;Mitchell Marsh;Johnson Charles;Matthew Wade;Darren;Mitchell;Josh;Charles;Johnson;Andre Fletcher;Darren Bravo;Andre;Josh Hazlewood;Samuels;Matthew;Marsh;Fletcher;Marlon Samuels;Hazlewood;Marlon;Bravo,,Windies

"LILLE, FRANCE: Germany's Julien Draxler repaid the faith of coach Joachim Low with a dazzling display featuring a volleyed goal and an assist as they thumped Slovakia 3-0 to book a Euro 2016 quarter-final with holders Spain or Italy.Brought in to replace the lacklustre Mario Goetze, the 22-year-old winger tormented Slovakia's defence with his dribbling and quick feet, creating a first-half goal for Mario Gomez and scoring himself with a superb volley in the second.The world champions went ahead when central defender Boateng, who had been passed fit after an injury scare, connected with a clearance in the eighth minute to volley home from 25 metres for his first international goal.The Germans then saw Mesut Ozil's weak 13th minute penalty saved but Gomez made no mistake two minutes from halftime when he tapped home a perfect cut-back from the marauding Draxler who added the third with a fine strike just past the hour mark.""We know his capabilities. He has two magic feet and I'm happy for him that it led to a goal. He always gives for the side and I'm happy for him,"" Gomez said of the Vfl Wolfsburg winger, who was instructed to take on his man by Loew.Draxler added: ""He (Loew) gave me a lot of self-confidence, trusted me and wanted me to search for a lot of one-on-ones.""I think we were superior and well deserving of a victory. It was nice to be in front after the goal by Boateng. We could even afford not to score the penalty.""strong>DEFLECTED VOLLEY</strongComfortable with either foot, Draxler utilised his speed and intelligence to good effect throughout, helping his side pin the Slovaks in their own half for much of the opening period.Boateng opened the scoring with a deflected volley following a corner and ran to celebrate with team doctor Hans-Wilhelm Mueller-Wohlfahrt, who helped him recover from a muscle injury sustained in their last group game with Northern Ireland.Ozil's weak penalty, well saved by Matus Kozacik, was one of the few blemishes in an otherwise superb Germany performance.Slovakia may have got the better of the Germans in a pre-Euro 2016 friendly but, apart from a few forays forward, they were all at sea.Five minutes before halftime Juraj Kucka forced a flying save from Germany captain Manuel Neuer as he sent Peter Pekarik's cross toward the top corner.Germany hit back immediately, Draxler turning Kucka inside out before squaring for Gomez to stab the ball home from close range to make it 2-0.Slovakia were marginally better in the second half but when the excellent Draxler hooked a volley into the top corner in the 63rd minute there was no way back.",6/27/2016,Draxler dazzles as Germany cruise into last eig,football,LILLE,Joachim Low;Hans-Wilhelm;Julien Draxler;Gomez;Hans-Wilhelm Mueller-Wohlfahrt;Peter Pekarik;Ozil;Manuel;Mario;Goetze;Neuer;Mueller-Wohlfahrt;Manuel Neuer;Pekarik;Joachim;Juraj;Loew.Draxler;Juraj Kucka;Mario Gomez;Mario Goetze;Mesut Ozil;Draxler;Boateng;Matus;Low;Mesut;Matus Kozacik;Kozacik;Kucka;Julien;Peter,Draxler;Julien Draxler,Loew;Northern Ireland.Ozil

"Toulouse: Eden Hazard scored his first goal of Euro 2016 as Belgium cruised into the quarter-finals with a 4-0 win to end Hungarys fairytale campaign.Belgium go into the European Championship quarter-finals for the first time since losing the 1980 final. They were dominant throughout at Stadium de Toulouse after Toby Alderweireld headed them into a 10th minute lead.The Red Devils wasted a series of great chances to put the game to bed before Michy Batshuayi with his first touch as a substitute, Hazard and Yannick Carrasco scored in the last 12 minutes.Belgium now meet Wales in Lille looking for a place in the semi-finals, but on the back of this promising performance coach Marc Wilmots will be looking for improvements in front of goal.<br/>Hungary impressively won their group but if they struck any fear into the hearts of Belgiums players, it did not show.From Kevin De Bruynes speculative fourth-minute strike that sailed Gabor Kiralys crossbar, the Red Devils were too hot for a Hungary making their return to a major tournament three decades after the 1986 World Cup.Almost from kick-off, Kiraly was kept busy as Romelu Lukaku, then De Bruyne, after Hazards superb delivery, tested the goalkeeper.When Adam Lang hauled De Bruyne to the ground on the left flank, the Manchester City forward promptly dished out the punishment with a superb inswinging free-kick thatAlderweireld headed past Kiraly at his back post. The opener settled Belgian nerves and Hazard in particular dazzled fans with some mazy runs, dribbles, and sublime passes that carved open the Hungarian defence.Despite their attractive football, a lack of clinical finishing left Belgium at risk during an encouraging Hungary fightback in the second half.Kiraly did well to block De Bruynes effort with his feet after he powered on to Lukakus sweeping pass behind the Hungarian defence.But De Bruyne headed Lukakus perfectly-weighted chip into Kiralys arms. And when Zoltan Gera gave possession away cheaply in midfield, Lukakus one-two with Radja Nainggolan saw the Everton striker skew wide as De Bruyne ran in unmarked at the back post.Dries Mertens won a free kick when he was charged from behind by Tamas Kadar but De Bruynes superbly-struck free kick bounced off Kiralys crossbar.The best of Hungarys few chances came just before the interval when midfielder Gergo Lovrencsics let fly a rasping drive that sailed just over.Moments later, Thibaut Courtois was at full stretch when Balazs Dzsudzsak fired between Nainggolans legs.Belgium spurned another chance on the stroke of half-time when Mertens close-range shot was deflected by Adam Lang.Immediately after the restart, Kiraly palmed over Hazards right-footed drive, but Hungary came fighting back. Striker Adam Szalai fired into the side-netting before rising above the Belgian defence to send a deflected header wide.Adam Pinters deflected lob forced Courtois to tip over, and then Roland Juhasz heading well wide from the resulting corner.But Belgium responded in style.Michy Batshuayi came off the bench to punish Hungary when he ran in unmarked after the hour to first-time his shot past Kiraly.The keeper was then left clutching at thin air when Hazard ran across the edge of the area unchallenged to beat him at his far post.Carrasco added their fourth in the first minute of added on time when he powered down the middle on the counter to beat Kiraly.",6/27/2016,Belgium hit four past Hungary at Euro 2016,football,Toulouse,Kiraly;Gergo;Bruynes;Eden;Thibaut;Gera;Balazs Dzsudzsak;Kadar;Toby;Michy;Gabor Kiralys;Gabor;Szalai;De;Dzsudzsak;Adam Lang;Mertens;Lang;Thibaut Courtois;Kiralys;Adam;Kevin;Lukakus;Adam Lang.Immediately;Roland Juhasz;Lukaku;De Bruynes;Marc;Romelu;De Bruyne;Alderweireld;Radja Nainggolan;Wilmots;Kevin De Bruynes;Batshuayi;Toby Alderweireld;Bruyne;Marc Wilmots;Nainggolan;Tamas Kadar;Yannick Carrasco;Radja;Hazard;Lovrencsics;Eden Hazard;Juhasz;Balazs;Courtois;Zoltan;Romelu Lukaku;Michy Batshuayi;Roland;Adam Szalai;Yannick;Carrasco;Gergo Lovrencsics;Lang.Immediately;Zoltan Gera;Tamas,,De Bruyne;Red Devils;Everton

Now its up to us to do it again on Sunday. We dont feel any pressure.

""And when they have the ball they play very well.""Chile coach Juan Antonio Pizzi said ""La Roja"" would have a plan ready to contain Messi, making it likely that the spiky midfield qualities of Gary Medel will be deployed to keep the Argentinian captain in check.""Playing against the most transcendental player in history is going to be no easy task,"" Pizzi said on Saturday.""Were going to use whatever weapons we can to stop our opponents actions, and of course, within these strategies there is the question of Messi,"" he added.Sundays final brings the curtain down on the first Copa America to be staged outside South America.The 16-team tournament comprising sides from throughout the Americas is being held to celebrate the centenary of the Copa America, which was first staged in 1916.",6/27/2016,Moment of truth for Messi as Copa final near,football,East Rutherford,Antonio;Lionel;Gerardo;Gerardo Martino;Lionel Messi;Gary Medel;Gary;Juan Antonio Pizzi;Pizzi;Martino;Juan;Messi;Medel,Messi;Lionel Messi,

"PARIS: Without the star names that have graced Italy sides in the past, coach Antonio Conte says the secret to their success at Euro 2016 has been to shun the mentality of a national team and behave like a club.Italy came into the European Championship with an ageing squad shorn of standout talents and with few tipping them for success.Their tournament performances, however, have confounded expectations and a 2-0 victory over Spain on Monday propelled them into the quarter-finals, where they will face Germany in Bordeaux on Saturday.Recent Italy teams went into major tournaments with individual talents such as Mario Balotelli or Andrea Pirlo, who attracted enormous amounts of media attention.For Conte, who has a notorious emphasis on the team ethic and industry over individuality, the way to achieve success is to mould the national team around the model of a club, where a well-drilled tactical system can stifle even the best opponents.""I've always said, right from the start of my work here with the national team, that the only road we can follow if we want a bit of success is to be like a club, to be like a team that play together every week -- we cannot allow ourselves to be a selection,"" Conte told reporters following the victory over Spain at the Stade de France.""I'm happy above all for the players. It's more than a month that we've been working tactically, technically, mentally and we've been trying to surprise everybody and I think we've succeeded to some extent.""Spain, who had won the previous two European titles, were comprehensively snuffed out, barely posing a threat until the closing stages of the game.Conte feels next opponents Germany, however, could pose a greater challenge.The world champions cruised through the group stage and thumped Slovakia 3-0 to reach the last eight.""We now face the best side at the European Championship next Saturday,"" Conte said.""It's going to be very, very hard in all aspects. We've got to do well to recover and prepare for Germany the best way we can.""We are without Thiago Motta (suspended) and that's a big blow, also because (Daniele) De Rossi took a knock to his hip.

"ARGENTINA: They were two small Argentina players with the same enormous challenge -- to meet the expectations of a soccer-mad country.Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi have both proved themselves to be skillful giants on the world soccer stage despite their diminutive frames of 1.65 and 1.70 metres respectively.But, while Maradona reached the heights by lifting the World Cup, Messi's only major international honour has been Olympic gold at the 2008 Beijing Games, even though at club level he has won four Champions Leagues with Spanish greats Barcelona.Argentina's failure to beat Chile in the final of the Copa America Centenario in the United States, a fourth lost final with the national team for Messi, proved too much for the little magician and he chose to quit international football on Sunday.The pressure (Messi) got from fans and media was and is very big. Messi must continue with the Maradona legacy is the message, sports medicine specialist Norberto Debbag said.The fans expect him to be leader and football star at the same time but it appears hes not prepared for the social pressure the national team demands, he told the Argentine website www.infobae.com.Maradona, who had so much natural skill that he would often juggle the ball during the team's warm-up with his bootlaces still undone, was always going to be a hard act to follow in an Argentina shirt.He had to be pulled out of a cesspit he fell into as a two-year-old, fought tooth-and-nail for everything he achieved and, with his immense footballing talent, led Argentina to their second World Cup triumph in 1986 in Mexico.It was rarely easy, though.POOR RESULTSArgentina arrived in Mexico after disappointing results in warm-up games and even the country's president was trying to get coach Carlos Bilardo replaced for fear of a poor tournament but a them-and-us attitude helped steer Maradonas team through.Argentina fans have always wanted Messi to replace him as the team's leader on such crusades, creating unbearable pressure with each failure to end a trophy drought dating back to 1993.The street-wise urchin approach that served Maradona so well does not work for Messi.Taking into account the Confederations Cup, Argentina have lost seven major finals since 1995, three of them to arch-rivals Brazil, and four since Messi's debut in 2005, including the 2014 World Cup final defeat by Germany.The man closest to the force of personality brought to the team by Maradona and former defender Oscar Ruggeri, who captained Argentina to their 13th and 14th Copa America titles in 1991 and 1993, is Javier Mascherano.But he has suffered even more than Messi with defeats in five finals from 2004.Coach Gerardo Martino brought in former Argentine rugby union international Federico Todeschini in March to help his team with their motivation.Argentina went on a run of eight straight wins, including a tournament group stage victory over Chile without an injured Messi. But for the final, they evidently needed something extra.Harmony appeared to reign in the squad, Messi came back into the team after recovering and scored a record 55th goal for his country against the United States in the semi-final.But he also had a troubled start to the build-up to the final, openly criticising the Argentine FA (AFA) over disrupted travel plans from Houston to East Rutherford in New Jersey.He then decided to stay quiet over his teams complaints about a lack of proper support from the AFA until after the final, telling reporters: Ill tell you afterwards.However, Argentina's defeat on penalties for the second time in a year to Chile has overtaken Messi's concerns for now.",6/28/2016,Messi fails to match Maradona success in Argentina shir,football,ARGENTINA,Debbag;Bilardo;Javier Mascherano.But;Oscar Ruggeri;Norberto Debbag;Lionel;Federico;Federico Todeschini;Gerardo;Todeschini;Gerardo Martino;Lionel Messi;Oscar;Javier;Maradona;Norberto;Carlos Bilardo;Martino;Ruggeri;Mascherano.But;Messi;Carlos,Maradona;Messi;Lionel Messi,Copa America Centenario;Barcelona.Argentina;AFA
"LONDON: For the Roger Federer fans on Centre Court and the legions watching on televisions around the world it was a reassuring sight as the Swiss swept past Argentina's Guido Pella into the second round of Wimbledon on Monday.Knee surgery and a nagging back injury had restricted the 17-times grand slam champion to 22 matches this season and his no-show at the recent French Open ended a run of 65 consecutive major appearances.Talk of time finally catching up with Federer has been doing the rounds. So all eyes were on the 34-year-old Swiss great as he stepped onto Centre Court where he had held the trophy aloft on seven occasions.But Federer began his 18th consecutive Wimbledon campaign with a tidy 7-6(5) 7-6(3) 6-3 victory that, while never spectacular, was relatively comfortable.He offered up not a single break point to the 51st-ranked Pella, and while he converted only one of the nine that came his way, he found an extra gear when required.Federer's only real moment of alarm came at 5-6, 0-30 in the second set. But he quickly killed the danger and waltzed through the tiebreak to take a two-set lead. With light fading he made light work of the third set.Federer's next appointment will be with British qualifier Marcus Willis, ranked 772nd in the world, on Wednesday.""It's a great, great story and I'm very, very excited to be playing him actually. It's the best story in tennis for a while,"" Federer told reporters when asked about playing Willis, a tennis coach who survived six rounds of qualifying.""It's going to be a great atmosphere.""While Federer was more than happy for Willis to take the spotlight after his win over Ricardas Berankis, he was more concerned with his own form and fitness after arriving at Wimbledon without a title in the first six months of the season for the first time since 2000.""Time heals a lot of problems, a lot of issues,"" Federer said. ""It's another day, another step in the right direction. It gives me confidence as I hopefully move forward.""I've worked as hard as I possibly could since February. My big goal was to not miss Wimbledon, to be here, hopefully at 100 percent. Don't know yet if I am. But I'm definitely here winning in straight sets in my first round against a good player.""",6/28/2016,Fit again Federer gets into his strid,tennis,LONDON,Roger;Federer;Marcus Willis;Ricardas Berankis;Berankis;Roger Federer;Marcus;Willis;Ricardas;Guido Pella;Guido;Pella,Federer;Roger Federer,Time

"LONDON: England's soccer journalists left their readers with no illusions on Tuesday after their side's Euro 2016 hopes were crushed by Iceland, describing the 2-1 loss as the worst in their history.Goals from Ragnar Sigurdsson and Kolbeinn Sigthorsson were enough to lead the tiny nation to a quarter-final clash with hosts France, with the loss costing England manager Roy Hodgson his job.British media held nothing back on Tuesday with the headlines proclaiming the loss as not only ""embarrassing"" but also ""the ultimate humiliation.""Many referred to England's shock 1-0 loss to the United States in the 1950 World Cup in Brazil in their post-match reports, though they felt the result in Nice would now surpass that as their worst in international soccer.""This was England's most humiliating night in international football: far worse than the 1950 World Cup defeat to the USA in Belo Horizonte,"" Paul Hayward wrote in The Telegraph.""Defeat here in Nice was always going to be a deeper trauma. This one came in the era of the Premier League as global industry.""The Guardian's Daniel Taylor also compared Monday's result to the 1950 loss in Belo Horizonte and suggested England's allusions to being one of the powerhouses of world soccer now needed to be questioned.""Hodgson's reign will be defined by a result comparable to losing to the United States in the 1950 World Cup,"" Taylor wrote. ""The now-familiar inquest will begin again in a country that likes to see itself as football royalty.""The Daily Mail's Martin Samuel described the loss as a ""seismic wave"" for English soccer and felt that Hodgson probably should have been sacked after the side's group phase exit at the 2014 World Cup.""What a waste the last two years have been,"" Samuel wrote. ""Hodgson should have gone in 2014, when England lasted two matches at the World Cup. He wasn't the man then, he isn't the man now.""There has been much talk of progress, promise and a strong culture of responsibility, but under pressure, that all evaporated.""While Hodgson was blamed for having a seemingly incoherent plan for the tournament with no clear idea on his strongest side or how to play the game, the players and the culture of the English Premier League were also criticised.""The reason why the nation struggles to feel empathy or connections with many of these players is the ego,"" Ian Herbert wrote in The Independent. ""Too famous, too important, too rich, too high and mighty... that is this England.""The Guardian's Dominic Fifield also criticised the more experienced players in the squad, who had not shown any leadership or stepped up to help their younger team members.""Hodgson had needed his most established players to excel if the team were going to make an impression,"" Fifield wrote. ""In the end they simply wilted like the rest.""The BBC's chief soccer writer Phil McNulty also felt the players would need to take a look at themselves under a new manager.""The ultimate responsibility lies with the manager but, make no mistake, he was badly let down by players capable of so much better,"" McNulty wrote.""Hodgson will take the blame and has paid the price but these highly paid Premier League players should not escape criticism.""",6/28/2016,British media call Iceland loss worst in English history,football,LONDON,Sigthorsson;McNulty;Paul;Phil McNulty;Samuel;Ragnar;Fifield;Belo Horizonte;Hayward;Phil;Dominic;Ragnar Sigurdsson;Paul Hayward;Taylor;Sigurdsson;Daniel Taylor;Martin;Daniel;Horizonte;Dominic Fifield;Hodgson;Herbert;Kolbeinn;Ian Herbert;Roy Hodgson;Ian;Belo;Martin Samuel;Roy;Kolbeinn Sigthorsson,,The Guardian;BBC;Nice;Premier League

"Marseille: A ""top class"" Portugal pose a bigger threat than just Cristiano Ronaldo, Poland coach Adam Nawalka insisted Wednesday ahead of their battle for a place in the Euro 2016 semi-finals.Ronaldo has been racking up the records in France as Portugal, who stunned Croatia to reach the last 16, go in search of unprecedented international glory.The Real Madrid star became the first player to score in four editions of the competition and is now just one goal away from matching French legend Michel Platinis record mark of nine goals in the finals.But with only two goals in four games, Ronaldo has failed to live up to expectations.Nawalka was reluctant to ""even speak about"" the threat posed by the three-time World Player of the Year, but insisted the biggest danger comes from a world class Portugal team.""I dont even want to mention Cristiano Ronaldo, whos one of the best in the world,"" Nawalka said in Marseille on Wednesday.""Football is a team game.

"MUMBAI: Saina Nehwal is better equipped to win a medal in Rio in August than the Indian shuttler was when she claimed a bronze at the London Olympics four years ago, former All England champion Prakash Padukone told Reuters.Hopes that the former world number one can turn bronze into a first Olympic gold medal in the sport for her country were raised when Nehwal won the Australian Superseries title.Rio will mark a third Olympics for Nehwal, who beat former world champions Ratchanok Intanon of Thailand and Wang Yihan before overpowering China's Sun Yu in the final in Sydney.""Saina has a lot more variety now,"" former men's world number one Padukone said in an interview.""I think she plays a lot more at the net now. Earlier her game was more or less predictable. She had a few strokes, she used to keep playing them and there were not many variations.""Now she has developed a lot more strokes, specially at the net. She is much more confident and that has made a big difference.""The victory in Australia came at just the right time for Nehwal, who had failed to reach a World Superseries final since last November in China and was returning from an Achilles injury she sustained at the end of last year.Padukone, who won the All England title in 1980 long before badminton was admitted to the Olympics in 1992, said the 26-year-old's game just needed a bit of tweaking.""Tactically she can do a little bit more. Maybe a plan A and plan B, which I'm sure she already has,"" said Padukone, who will be a panellist for broadcaster Star Sports during the 2016 Games. ""Maybe if something doesn't work, then she has to have a different plan.""It's just the question of a little bit of polishing. She definitely has everything otherwise she wouldn't have been where she is.""China has long been the dominant force in the sport, sweeping all five titles at London four years ago, but their shuttlers no longer top the world rankings heading to Rio.While Malaysian Lee Chong Wei tops the men's singles rankings, Carolina Marin of Spain leads the women's list with Nehwal in sixth place.World Badminton has also limited each nation to two singles entrants in each event - down from the three at London and previous Games - and Padukone feels that makes a Chinese sweep of badminton gold in Rio less likely.""They are no longer the dominating force going by the results we have seen in the last 12 to 24 months,"" Padukone said. ""Earlier when the draw used to come, everybody used to hope there are no Chinese.""That's no longer the case, that fear is not there anymore. That's good for the game. For the Indians, though they wouldn't say it, but it used to be a mind-block.""India's best chance of medals will come in the women's singles, Padukone said, where as well as Nehwal they have PV Sindhu ranked 10th in the world.Padukone said the most important thing for the Indian shuttlers was to peak during the Aug. 11-20 Rio competition.""When you go there it doesn't matter if in the last two months you have beaten all the top players and you have been the world number one,"" Padukone said.""It's important that you reach the peak and play your best during that particular week.

"RIO DE JANEIRO: Ask athletes what goes into Olympic gold medals, and they will likely say sweat and years of training. For Brazil's National Mint the answer is simpler: recycled silver.The 500-gram (17.6-ounce) Olympic gold medals that Usain Bolt, Michael Phelps and other athletes will be competing for in Rio de Janeiro are nearly 99 percent silver. They contain just 1.2 percent gold, mostly used as plating.""It's a great honor and a great responsibility,"" said Victor Hugo Berbert, head of medal-making, as he showed Reuters around the mint in Rio de Janeiro.Each of the 5,130 Olympic and Paralympic medals takes about 48 hours to make, said Berbert, who has an 80-strong team working shifts around the clock.The medals are the most sustainable in Olympic history. Much of the silver is recycled from old mirrors and X-ray plates. The gold is free of mercury, which is often used to separate gold from ore and can poison local ecosystems if not carefully disposed of.Nike, the winged goddess of victory in Ancient Greece, is minted on one side below the five Olympic rings, while the discipline for which the medal has been won is engraved along its edge. The other side bears the Rio 2016 logo.""It's a sense of great satisfaction that our work will be worn on the chests of athletes who have given everything to win,"" said Nelson Neto Carneiro, who has worked at the mint for over 40 years.",6/29/2016,Broken mirrors X ray plates Olympic gold not what it ,olympics,RIO DE JANEIRO,Nelson;Victor Hugo Berbert;Carneiro;Michael Phelps;Phelps;Victor;Neto;Michael;Hugo;Nelson Neto Carneiro;Berbert,,Reuters
"INDIA: Virat Kohli was not satisfied with being an average cricketer and the India test captain says that a desire to reach the next level was his motivation for improved conditioning.The 27-year-old is widely considered to be the fittest cricketer in the Indian side, complementing his batting with razor-sharp skills in the field.A lean patch with the bat during the 2012 Indian Premier League Twenty20 tournament acted as the catalyst for Kohli to make a ""lifestyle choice"".""Until IPL 2012, I did not focus much on the physical aspect,"" said Kohli, who tops the world Twenty20 batting rankings and is second on the one-day international list.""I never got into the minute details of fitness, things like what I need to eat from morning to night, how much I need to work out and how much I need to train.""After that IPL, I started listening to my body.

"MARSEILLE, FRANCE: Poland have an impressive defensive record at Euro 2016 but standing in their way to a semi-final spot is arguably one of sport's greatest-ever athletes, Cristiano Ronaldo.The monstrous Polish centre back pairing of Michal Pazdan and Kamil Glik face their toughest challenge yet when they come up against Portugal in the last-eight clash in Marseille on Thursday, though their previous matches have not provided much by way of preparation for facing the Real Madrid star.Describing 29-year-old Ronaldo as the ""perfect athlete"", U.S. lifestyle magazine Men's Health says he hits speeds of more than 32 kph, jumps nearly a metre in the air off one leg, runs an average of 16 km per match and hits more winners in the last 20 minutes than anyone else.He is the only player to have scored a goal in four Euros going back to 2004 and, while he struggled to find his feet early in this year's tournament, there are signs that he is back to his sublime best.He scored twice in Portugal's last group match against Hungary -- an audacious back heel and a towering header -- and has had a hand in two of his country's other three goals, most importantly the shot that set up Ricardo Quaresma to score the easiest of extra-time winners in their last-16 win over Croatia.For their part, Poland are good shotstoppers.They have conceded just three goals all year and only one in the Euros, an outrageous bicycle kick by Switzerland's Xherdan Shaqiri in their round-of-16 tie which they eventually won on penalties. Only Germany still have a clean sheet in Euro 2016.Poland's matches in France so far will have done little to prepare them for the pace, power and superhuman heading ability that Ronaldo possesses, however.Their top-ranked opponents to date, Germany, fielded the diminutive Mario Goetze in their group-stage stalemate and the 'false nine' presented little trouble in the box, constantly dropping back into midfield to pick up the ball.Other group matches against Northern Ireland, who did not get a decent effort on target, and Ukraine, who departed after failing to score in any of their games, were fairly straightforward.The late Shaqiri wonder goal in their last outing did unsettle the Poles, with Switzerland gaining the upper hand in extra time. But the rearguard held firm, forcing the tie to penalties.That defence will have to be immaculate again if Poland are to have a chance of progressing because they have offered little up front.They have scored two goals fewer than any other team in the last eight with hitman Robert Lewandowski, the leading scorer in Euro 2016 qualifying with 13 goals, mustering just two attempts on target so far, both in the last match.The captain's opening penalty in the shootout, which left the goalkeeper stranded as it flew into the top right corner, could be the confidence boost he needs.It is the scintillating left winger Kamil Grosicki who presents the biggest danger for Portugal's ageing but experienced defence led by 33-year-old Pepe.For Polish coach Adam Nawalka, the Ronaldo factor presents a tactical conundrum. Is he prepared to press high in search of a goal, knowing that a wrong step could unleash the Portuguese counter-attack, or does he sit back and risk becoming just a spectator to another Ronaldo masterclass?Whoever wins on Thursday will play either Wales or Belgium next, seen as the easier route to the final with hosts France, world champions Germany, Italy and surprise quarter-finalists Iceland on the other side of the draw.",6/29/2016,Preview Ronaldo poses biggest threat yet to Polish rearguard,football,MARSEILLE,Ronaldo.The;Ricardo Quaresma;Ronaldo;Quaresma;Glik;Ronaldo masterclass?Whoever;masterclass?Whoever;Cristiano Ronaldo.The;Mario;Grosicki;Goetze;Kamil;Xherdan;Robert;Lewandowski;Michal;Cristiano;Xherdan Shaqiri;Kamil Glik;Adam Nawalka;Nawalka;Ricardo;Mario Goetze;Michal Pazdan;Kamil Grosicki;Adam;Shaqiri;Robert Lewandowski;Pazdan,Preview Ronaldo,Real Madrid;Men's Health

"MUMBAI: Denied another stint as Indias head coach, Ravi Shastri has been embroiled in an ugly spat with former captain Sourav Ganguly, who was part of the panel which awarded the job to Anil Kumble last week.The coachs post was vacant since Shastris 18-month tenure as the team director ended with Indias semi-final exit at the World Twenty20 tournament on home soil earlier this year.For the post, the Indian cricket board (BCCI) received 57 applications which were made available to an advisory panel that included ex-captains Sachin Tendulkar and Ganguly and former batsman VVS Laxman.The panel met the final contenders, including Shastri who spoke via skype, before Kumble, a contemporary of the ex-cricketers on the panel, landed the job despite his lack of coaching experience.Shastri told the Indian media that Gangulys absence during his interview was disrespectful and he advised the former captain to be present at important meetings in the future.Ganguly, one of the most successful Indian captains, said he had taken the BCCIs approval to attend a meeting of his state cricket association, of which he is the president.""I just feel that the comments are very personal and if Ravi Shastri feels that I am responsible for him not being the coach of India, hes living in a fools world,"" Ganguly told television reporters in Kolkata.""Its a committee and there are people in the committee who are of more repute than I am and there are other people involved also who were consulted and spoken about.So thats disappointing.""Ganguly said the panel had agreed his request to resume the interview after completing the associations meeting.""Once I came here to this meeting, I got a message from (BCCI secretary) Mr (Ajay) Shirke that the other two members are requesting if they could continue with Ravi, which I was fine with.""I said fine, I know I have been stuck with this and you please go ahead and do it.That happens everywhere in the world and thats the exact story.""Ganguly said Shastri should also have made the effort to be present in person during his interview.""Since hes spoken about disrespect, and honestly I say this with anger, that he gave me a suggestion that in the future that I should be available for such meetings,"" Ganguly said.""I have an advice for him also.When the coach of India is selected, and its one of the most important jobs in cricket, he should be in front of the committee giving his presentation and not sit in Bangkok on holiday and make a presentation on camera, especially when someone, who is one of the greatest cricketers of India all time (Anil Kumble), spoke for two hours nearly.",6/30/2016,Shastri Ganguly India coaching snub,cricket,MUMBAI,Kumble;Ravi Shastri;Ajay);Shastri;Ajay) Shirke;Shastris;Anil Kumble;Sachin;Ravi;Sachin Tendulkar;Anil;Ganguly;Indias;Shirke;Sourav Ganguly;Sourav;Tendulkar,Shastri Ganguly,Indias;BCCI
"OMAHA, NEBRASKA: Determined to exit swimming on his own terms, Michael Phelps cleared a major hurdle on the road to Rio on Wednesday, qualifying for a fifth Olympics with a victory that has paved the way to more Games glory.Inspired, motivated and sober, Phelps heads to Rio thanks to his 200 metres butterfly win at the U.S. Olympic trials with the goal of adding to his staggering record total of 22 medals, including 18 gold, and pen a happy ending to a brilliant career that he feels he denied himself at the 2012 London Olympics.""Coming back and being able to have the opportunity to finish how I want,"" said Phelps, of his motivation. ""I'm doing this because I wanted to.""Thinking about the ups and downs we've gone through in and out of the pool to get to this point and not feeling an absolute 100 percent but still being able to get the job done.""I think things are probably going to hit me a lot more emotionally now than what they would have in the past, because I'm enjoying the moment and I'm embracing the moment.""For Phelps, this Olympic journey is more important than the destination, a trip into retirement that he is determined to share with his fiancee Nicole and infant son Boomer, who were among the sellout crowd of 14,000 at the CenturyLink Centre.At London, which he had declared to be his last Games, Phelps won four gold and overall six medals but walked away with the regret that he simply went through the motions.He subsequently talked of a golf career but eventually found himself testing the waters of a swimming comeback which was interrupted by a second drunk driving arrest in 2014 and a stint in rehab that laid the foundation for Phelps' transformation from a party boy to a family man.After accepting his medal for his 200 fly win, Phelps searched the darkened arena for his partner and child, joining them poolside where he hugged Nicole and planted a kiss on his son's forehead.""I wanted to go over, and I've always given my family my flowers and stuffed animal, I guess that's his (Boomer's) first stuffed animal from a race,"" said Phelps, who will have Nicole and Boomer join him in Rio despite the Zika threat.

LONDON: Jason Roy fell five runs short of setting a new batting record but his superb 162 still helped England win the fourth ODI against Sri Lanka and take an unassailable 2 0 series lead on Wednesday.Surrey s South African born opener took centre stage on his home county ground and hammered the second highest individual one day score by an England batsman.His fireworks lit up the gloomy rain filled South London skies to ensure England captured the series at The Oval.His second hundred in three ODI games 162 runs off 118 including 13 fours and three sixes helped England clinch a six wicket win with overs to spare as they chased down their revised victory target of 308 with ease.And they clinched the series 2 0 with just one game left in Cardiff on Saturday.It was England s second highest successful one day run chase and they did it in 42 overs.Sadly for Roy he fell just five runs short of overtaking the highest score by an England batsman with another Robin Smith s 167 not out against Australia at Edgbaston in 1993 still holding firm.He was bowled by Nuwan Pradeep with England in sight of the finishing line.Jonny Bairstow and Jos Buttler saw them home with 11 balls remaining.At Edgbaston Roy was accompanied by fellow opener Alex Hales who also made an unbeaten ton in that match.But this time he was helped mainly by Joe Root whose 65 showed a return to form for the Yorkshireman who had struggled recently and had gone six games with just one score over 11. But if Root had his mojo back Roy merely continued in the kind of vain which has made him one of the world s most destructive and stylish one day performers.A back injury to Alex Hales during Sri Lanka s innings of 305 5 off a reduced number of overs due to the rain meant Moeen Ali had to open with Roy instead.But Roy shrugged off the early loss of Ali for just two and the batsman cut and carved the Sri Lankan attack apart.England raced out the blocks needing more than seven an over and Roy ensured they were always up with the required rate the skies still dark and threatening to rain once more.Root departed a lazy top edged sweep saw him caught by Nuwan Pradeep off Danushka Gunathilaka and his 149 run second wicket partnership with Roy came to a sad end.Morgan looked well set until he was superbly caught by the diving Gunathilaka for 22 off Suranga Lakmal with England on 221. Roy was joined by Jonny Bairstow and reached 150 but was kicking himself when he was bowled by Pradeep with England so close to the finishing line.Earlier Sri Lanka had produced their best batting display of the series so far with four men hitting half centuries.The tourists recovered from losing opener Kusal Perera in the second over run out by Jonny Bairstow for just a single to give England s attack the run around.Morgan chose to field first and he may have been regretting it for a while as Gunathilake and Kusal Mendis put on 128 for the second wicket off just 111 balls.Mendis was struck 13 boundaries in his 77 while Gunathilaka was also aggressive with seven fours in his 62. The persistent rain finally came down hard enough to force the players from the field for a two and a half hour delay with Sri Lanka on 127 1 from 18.1 overs at the time.England fought back with Adil Rashid claiming the wickets of Mendis (77) and Gunathilaka (62) but England still had to deal with the in form Chandimal (63) and his captain Angelo Matthews (67 not out) who picked up the gauntlet.and helped Sri Lanka amass 305 5 from 42 overs.England s target was revised up by just three runs but with Roy building up a full head of steam they cruised home comfortably.,6/30/2016,Jason Roy stunning knock powers England victory,cricket,LONDON,Jonny Bairstow;Rashid;Chandimal;Angelo;Edgbaston;Jason;Buttler;Nuwan;Danushka Gunathilaka;Alex;Joe;instead.But;Bairstow;Root;Nuwan Pradeep;Edgbaston Roy;Smith;Adil Rashid;Joe Root;Moeen Ali;Jos;Matthews;Robin Smith;Adil;Roy;Robin;Moeen;Mendis;Kusal;Hales;Kusal Perera;Kusal Mendis;Angelo Matthews;Roy instead.But Roy;Gunathilake;Gunathilaka;Jos Buttler;Danushka;Pradeep;Jonny;Jason Roy;Alex Hales;Ali;Perera,Jason Roy,
"LONDON: Few players have reduced the great Roger Federer to a role as secondary attraction on Wimbledon's Centre Court but for one hour and 25 minutes on Wednesday he had just a walk-on part in the Marcus Willis fairytale.The seven-times champion enjoys too much deep-rooted affection at the All England Club to be cast as a real pantomime villain, but for once the cheers were all behind the 25-year-old local hero on the other side of the net.Federer's 81st Wimbledon match, of course, ended in victory.Even the most over-egged Hollywood script could not have had him losing to world number 772 Willis, whose transformation from a 30 pounds ($40.30) an hour tennis coach to Wimbledon sensation has captured the imagination of the sporting world.But the swaggering Swiss was at least made to break sweat under the closed roof before claiming a 6-0 6-3 6-4 victory.Willis had his photo taken with Federer, 34, before the warm-up and could hardly stop grinning.He even celebrated a practise serve with a raised fist as his friends went through their song-list at court side.But when Willis lost the opening set in 25 minutes without managing a game you feared the worst.strong>DEAFENING ROAR</strongSo when he did finally trouble the scoreboard, holding serve in the eighth game, the deafening roar rivalled the one heard when fellow Briton Andy Murray ended 77 years of pain by beating Novak Djokovic in the 2013 final.From then on the quirky left-hander's unorthodox shots kept 17-times major champion Federer guessing at times, especially his grass-hugging backhand slices and cheeky drop volleys.Federer joined in with some dazzling party pieces of his own but played largely within himself -- smiling occasionally as Willis bathed in an unfamiliar spotlight.Afterwards he paid Willis the ultimate compliment.""I'll remember most of the Centre Court matches here at Wimbledon, but this one will stand out because it's that special and probably not going to happen again for me to play against a guy 770 in the world,"" Federer told reporters.""The support he got, the great points he played. In some ways, I enjoyed it as much as I possibly could, but I also had to put my head down and focus hard to get the lead.""strong>PUSHED HARDER</strongFederer broke for a 5-2 lead in the second and closed it out two games later but was pushed harder in the third as Willis, who survived six qualifying rounds before stunning Lithuania's Ricardas Berankis in round one, kept his nose in front.Federer, moving well after missing the French Open with a back injury, looked a touch relieved when he broke at 4-4 in the third set, though, and claimed victory when Willis sliced a backhand long in the next game.""Today again, after the match, I just said he played great and I wished him the best for the rest of the year,"" Federer said.

"Paris: Poland and Portugals football authorities became the latest to come under scrutiny from UEFA as European footballs governing body opened disciplinary proceedings against both federations on Friday.Portugal progressed to the semi-finals of Euro 2016 with a 5-3 penalty shootout win in Marseille after the teams were tied at 1-1 after extra-time.The Polish Football Federation (PZPN) face sanctions for the setting off of fireworks, crowd disturbances and a delay to kick-off.Meanwhile, the Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) could also be punished for the setting off of fireworks and field invasions by supporters as one fan ran towards superstar Cristiano Ronaldo after entering the pitch in extra-time.The FPF had already been cited by UEFA when a fan ran onto the field to take a picture with Ronaldo at the end of their 0-0 draw with Austria on June 18th.Both cases will be dealt with by the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body on 21 July.Federations from Hungary, Belgium, Albania, Romania, England, Russia, Croatia and Turkey have all faced varying degrees of sanctions from UEFA during a tournament often disrupted by fan troubles.",07-01-2016,Poland Portugal face UEFA disciplinary prob,football,Paris,Ronaldo;Cristiano Ronaldo;Cristiano,,UEFA Control;Football Federation;Portuguese Football Federation;UEFA;FPF
"SPIELBERG, Austria: Championship leader Nico Rosberg clocked the fastest ever lap at the Red Bull Ring on Friday as he topped the times in an incident-filled opening free practice for this weekends Austrian Grand Prix.The German, who celebrated his 31st birthday on Monday, recorded a lap in one minute and 7.373 seconds to outpace nearest rival and Mercedes team-mate defending three-time champion Lewis Hamilton by nearly four-tenths of a second.Hamilton has a 24-points lead in the drivers championship ahead of Hamilton and this weekend is seeking his third successive victory in Austria since the event returned to the F1 calendar in 2014.Briton Hamilton, also 31, was four-tenths of a second off the pace set by Rosberg as he wound up second, after some off-track excursions, ahead of four-time champion German Sebastian Vettel and his under-pressure Ferrari team-mate Finn Kimi Raikkonen.Australian Daniel Ricciardo was fifth for Red Bull as they strove to impress on their home Red Bull Ring circuit in the Styrian Alps.His team-mate Dutch teenager Max Verstappen was unable to stay with him and finished down in eight place after a difficult session that saw him twice run off over the kerbs and damage his car.Verstappen complained that the new kerbs on the circuit were unbelievable and dangerous. Early in the session, he broke his front wing when he ran across the bright yellow kerbs at the exit of the penultimate corner.Speaking on team radio, he said: ""The yellow kerbs in the fast corners are really dangerous.... Those yellow things, it is just unbelievable.""After repairs, he resumed, but crashed again into a gravel trap with half an hour to go, this time appearing to damage his cars front right suspension at Turn Six.Spaniard Carlos Sainz, who this week was confirmed as staying with Toro Rosso next year, was sixth ahead of Brazilian Felipe Massa of Williams with Russian Daniil Kvyat taking ninth in the second Toro Rosso and Valtteri Bottas of Williams 10th.",07-01-2016,Formula One Rosberg on top after opening free practi,racing,SPIELBERG,Finn;Nico Rosberg;Rosberg;Max;Felipe Massa;Valtteri Bottas;Max Verstappen;Williams;Lewis Hamilton;Hamilton;Kvyat;Sebastian Vettel;Carlos Sainz;Nico;Raikkonen.Australian;Felipe;Rosso;Massa;Daniel;Bottas;Daniil;Vettel;Lewis;Sainz;Kimi;Finn Kimi Raikkonen.Australian Daniel Ricciardo;Verstappen;Ricciardo;Toro Rosso;Daniil Kvyat;Carlos;Sebastian;Valtteri;Toro,,Ferrari;Mercedes;Red Bull
"ISLAMABAD: Former chief selector Salahuddin has said that the cricket series between Pakistan and India is very important at the moment.The series between Pakistan and India would also be beneficial for International Cricket Council (ICC), a private news channel quoted him as saying.It may be mentioned that the PCB signed an agreement in which it agreed to the idea of the Big 3s influence on world cricket in 2014 with the clear understanding that India would play six series with us over a period of eight years.These series would have been played in India or a mutually agreed venue in a third country.The BCCI told PCB that they needed permission from the Indian government for these series and PCB agreed to wait for that but that permission never came through.PCB even agreed to play India in Sri Lanka back in December but even that permission was not forthcoming from the Indian sideand as a result the series didnt happen.It also showed that India had not met PCBs conditions for accepting the Big 3 formula.Speaking about Salman Butt and Muhammad Asif, he said they should also be given a chance in the Pakistan Super League (PSL).He also said that Pakistan team has not found replacement of Muhammad Asif yet and Muhammad Amir will have to be very careful in England.",07-01-2016,Pak India cricket very important says Salahuddi,cricket,ISLAMABAD,Amir;Butt;Muhammad Amir;Asif;Muhammad;Salman;Muhammad Asif;Salman Butt,Salahuddi,International Cricket Council;ICC;BCCI;PCB
"LONDON: Andy Murray produced the kind of imperious form that has propelled him into two grand slam finals this year as he beat Taiwan's Lu Yen-hsun 6-3 6-2 6-1 in the Wimbledon second round on Thursday.Lu, the son of a chicken farmer, ruffled a few feathers on Centre Court when he jumped out to a 2-0 lead before extending it to 3-1 in the opening set.However, once Murray had levelled for 3-3, it did not take him long to clip his rival's wings.From 3-2 up in the second set, Murray won seven games on the trot as Lu struggled to find a way to keep pace with Murray's potent groundstrokes.A Lu double fault on match point allowed Murray to hurry off court for a royal audience with Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall.After huffing and puffing his way through five-setters in the first two rounds of the French Open, Murray was relieved that his start to the grasscourt major was much more serene.Six sets contested, six sets won.""It's always difficult to know how close you are to being your best. But I was hitting the ball clean. I was happy with how I played,"" said the world number two, who will next face Australian John Millman.Lu, affectionately known as Rendy on the tour, had handed Murray a chastening defeat in the first round of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.Since then, however, the man who beat Andy Roddick to reach the 2010 Wimbledon quarter-finals has failed to win a set against the Scot in four subsequent meetings.On a comeback trail after being out of action for four months having undergone right elbow surgery in January, Lu had come into the match on an 11-match winning streak on grass after claiming two Challenger titles in the run up to Wimbledon.But despite the promising start against Murray, his luck quickly ran out.""I finished the match really well.

"LONDON: Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic is joining Manchester United and will play for his first Premier League club at the age of 34 under his former manager Jose Mourinho.""Time to let the world know my next destination is @Manutd,"" Ibrahimovic said on Twitter on Thursday.Ibrahimovic had been widely expected to join the English club after informing Paris St Germain that he was leaving after four years in the French capital.The much-travelled striker will link up with Mourinho, his former manager at Inter Milan, who has just taken over at Old Trafford.United, who have not paid a fee to sign the out-of-contract Ibrahimovic, will be the eighth club of a career which began with his hometown team Malmo in 1999 and has included spells at Ajax, Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona and AC Milan.He has scored 392 goals in 677 games and won a trophy in each season of his career since 2001.Beyond the silverware, however, it is the box-office appeal of the Swede which has appealed to United, whose supporters have bemoaned the lack of star-quality in their teams since the departure of Alex Ferguson.United were widely criticised for playing boring football last season under now departed manager Louis van Gaal. Boring is not a word which could be used to describe the flamboyant Ibrahimovic, who scored 50 goals in 51 matches for PSG last season.United have not yet confirmed the deal but British media reported that he will undergo a medical at Old Trafford on Friday.Ibrahimovic announced his retirement from international football last week after Sweden's early exit from Euro 2016.He will link up with his new team mates next month and could feature on the club's tour of Asia, for which they are due to depart on July 19.",07-01-2016,Zlatan Ibrahimovic to join Manchester United,football,LONDON,Zlatan;Alex;van;Jose Mourinho;Gaal;Mourinho;Ibrahimovic;Ferguson.United;Zlatan Ibrahimovic;Alex Ferguson.United;Jose;Louis van Gaal;Louis,Zlatan Ibrahimovic,Juventus;Paris St Germain;Barcelona;PSG;Inter Milan;United;Manchester United;AC Milan.He;Premier League;Ajax
"CANBERRA: Australia coach Darren Lehmann has urged cricket's governing body to help reduce the workload on players competing in all three forms of the game as he fears the current packed schedule is unsustainable.As the Indian Premier League (IPL) appears set to capitalise on recent International Cricket Council (ICC) changes to the schedule through a ""mini IPL"" in September, Lehmann fears such a tournament would further restrict time off for his players.In 2015, Australian cricketers who played all three formats spent on average 280 days overseas. Under Cricket Australia (CA) contracts, players are given a six-week break from commitments, which many use to sign lucrative IPL contracts.Lehmann said that while the financial incentive to play in India was tempting, it often wore players out and the ICC should use a common sense approach to future scheduling so that the toll on bodies was not too high.""If it keeps going like this, with players playing IPL as well, they are inevitably going to break down,"" Lehmann told Australian media on Friday.""Hopefully changes will happen at the ICC and then you will see a refined schedule which will be better.""Lehmann said while players often consider setting themselves up for life by playing in the IPL, it was a ""tough conundrum"" for national selectors, as they are reluctant to advise players not to take on out-of-contract commitments.""If you look across a two-year cycle, all of our players have had to come home at some point,"" he said, while referring to injuries Steve Smith (wrist) and Mitchell Marsh (hamstring) picked up in the most recent IPL season.Lehmann believes that while players may be primed to perform under match day stresses, it was the constant travel, variable conditions and lack of adequate rest which was putting them most at risk.""It's not so much the cricket; it's the travel to these places. You're on the road, you have training and all that stuff,"" he said.The ICC is currently considering the introduction of a two-tiered test Championship and a one-day league, which would go some way to lightening the workload.",07-01-2016,Lehmann ICC intervention prevent player burnou,cricket,CANBERRA,Darren Lehmann;Mitchell Marsh;Smith;Darren;Steve;Mitchell;Marsh;Steve Smith;Lehmann,,IPL;Indian Premier League;International Cricket Council;ICC
"DHAKA: Test crickets newest nations are in despair at plans to split the format into two divisions, fearing it could undo decades of hard-fought progress on the field and kill interest in the game.Crickets governing body the International Cricket Council (ICC) is meeting in Edinburgh this week to debate proposals for the seven top-ranked teams to establish a de facto premier league in a bid to boost waning interest in Tests.Under the scheme being considered by the ICC, the other three countries with Test status would join a five-strong second division along with Afghanistan and Ireland.<br/> While the shake-up would guarantee crickets leading nations play each other every other year, the other sides would be starved of matches which draw in crowds and lucrative broadcast deals.As things stand, the two latest arrivals at crickets top table -- Bangladesh and Zimbabwe -- will be doomed to the second tier and could be joined by another relative newcomer Sri Lanka.""This will spell the death of international cricket as weve known it,"" said Ahmed Sazzadul Alam, a Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) director.Bangladesh lobbied for years to join crickets elite before playing their first Test in 2000. Their record has been poor, winning just seven of their 93 Tests and they are currently ranked ninth, just above Zimbabwe.However, performances have improved significantly of late and Bangladesh have only lost six of their last 18 Tests.BCB vice president Mahbubul Anam warned Bangladesh ""would go backwards"" if they stop playing teams such as England and India, both of whom they are due to play later this year. ""The more we play against competitive sides, the better well get,"" said Anam.Alistair Campbell, a former director of Zimbabwes board, appreciated the arguments for a split because of the gulf in class between the top and bottom sides.But Campbell, a former captain who played in Zimbabwes inaugural Test against India in 1992, said it would be heartbreaking if current players would never be able to compete against the best.""Its going to be a tragedy if you are growing up in a country like Zimbabwe or Bangladesh,"" he told AFP. ""It means you might never get the opportunity to play with top tier sides. That might drive players to go and seek greener pastures.""There are similar fears in Sri Lanka which has fallen down the rankings in the last two years after batting greats Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene retired.<br/> Sri Lanka are currently ranked seventh and in danger of being overtaken by an improving West Indies by the time the proposed split comes into force.Sri Lanka also struggled in the first decade after their inaugural Test in 1982 but then found their feet and won the 1996 World Cup.Sidath Wettimuny, who scored Sri Lankas first Test century, warned the architects of the split were playing with fire.""Its okay to make some tweaks but what is proposed is going to be a disaster in every sense of the word,"" he said.Sri Lankan boards secretary Mohan de Silva was cool on the proposal. ""We are not very much in favour, but we need to discuss with our executive committee after studying it carefully before taking a final decision,"" he wrote in a text from Scotland.But Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera insisted the shake-up should be opposed as it would ""have a negative impact"".Sri Lankas cash-strapped board is hugely dependent on TV money and ticket revenue from tours by the likes of India and Australia. But neither broadcasters nor spectators will pay significant amounts for matches involving minnows such as Ireland.""If you club the weakest teams in one league, wholl be interested in watching those games? This will lead to financial ruin,"" Jayasekera told AFP.The BCBs Alam also warned of dire financial consequences. ""There would be an inevitable loss of interest among younger followers of and a decline in interest from the media and sponsors,"" he said.""The resulting downturn in revenues would undermine development programmes and funding of domestic leagues.

"Spielberg, Austria: Sebastian Vettel topped the times ahead of his Ferrari team-mate Kimi Raikkonen after Nico Rosberg crashed heavily in Saturdays dramatic third and final practice ahead of Sundays Austrian Grand Prix.In a clear signal of a return to form in much warmer weather, with track temperatures at the newly asphalted Red Bull Ring circuit rising to 44 degrees Celsius, Ferrari showed superior pace and tyre performance as championship leading rivals Mercedes struggled.Defending three-time world champion Lewis Hamilton managed to wind up third behind the Ferraris ahead of the Red Bulls of Australian Daniel Ricciardo and Dutch teenager Max Verstappen with Finn Valtteri Bottas sixth ahead of Williams team-mate Felipe Massa of Brazil.But the session was overshadowed by championship leader Rosbergs crash, which saw the session red-flagged to a halt for 10 minutes. It was confirmed by the team that the German suffered a suspension failure.Rosberg appeared to be pushing for a fast lap on a new set of ultra-soft tyres - on which both Mercedes men have struggled for performance - as he came out of Turn Two.Hamilton had followed him out also on ultra-softs as Rosbergs Mercedes showed heavy left rear wheel vibrations as he ran wide across the kerb.He seemed to be clear of the controversial yellow baguette kerbs that were criticised so severely on Friday by Verstappen.Rosbergs car appeared to suffer a suspension failure and he was thrown into a spin that saw him crash off the barriers on the left off the track before coming to a halt.He was unhurt, but the session was red-flagged to a halt for 10 minutes during which the debris was cleared and an angry Rosberg gave vent to his feelings, waving his arms in frustration in the Mercedes garage.His accident demonstrated clearly how difficult Mercedes were finding it to manage the ultra-soft tyres and extract good performance.On re-start, Hamilton went out and clocked a lap in 1:07.7 to jump to fourth on the monitors, some way off the pace set by Vettel who did 1:07.098, another outright lap record at the Red Bull Ring.In a final flurry of action, Hamilton kept off the kerbs and rose to fourth and then third before the chequered flag.Rosbergs misfortune may have handed Hamilton a chance to cut his team-mates 24-point lead in the title race if he can take advantage in qualifying scheduled to take place later Saturday.",07-02-2016,Formula One Vettel fastest after Rosberg cr,racing,SPIELBERG,Finn;Rosbergs;Nico Rosberg;Rosberg;Max;Felipe Massa;Daniel Ricciardo;Max Verstappen;Lewis Hamilton;Hamilton;Finn Valtteri Bottas;Sebastian Vettel;Nico;Felipe;Massa;Daniel;Kimi Raikkonen;Bottas;Spielberg;Vettel;Lewis;Raikkonen;Kimi;Verstappen;Ricciardo;Sebastian;Valtteri,Rosberg;Nico Rosberg,Ferrari;Williams;Red Bulls;Rosbergs Mercedes;Red Bull Ring

"Le Mont-Saint-Michel, France: Reigning champion Chris Froome says this years Tour de France is made for the specialist climbers, but it begins on Saturday with a flat stage favouring sprinters.Saturdays Grand Depart takes place at the picturesque tourist resort of Mont Saint-Michel, before finishing 188km later at Utah Beach, made famous as one of the main sites of the Normandy Landings during World War II.One of the big favourites for the opening stage is German sprint king Marcel Kittel, back at the Tour after a one-year injury and illness induced hiatus.Having won the opening stage in 2013 and 2014, Kittel is gunning for a hat-trick, but he knows it will be tough.The other main favourite is his countryman Andre Greipel, who won four stages last year in Kittels absence.Neither Englishman Mark Cavendish, who is third on the all-time list of Tour stage wins with 26, nor world champion Peter Sagan of Slovakia can be discounted.A breakaway group will likely animate the first stage, but the sprinters teams will never let them far off the leash and will take no chances in reeling them before setting up a fast, furious and perhaps manic bunch finish.Two years ago, Cavendish crashed in just such a mass sprint, breaking his collarbone and being forced out of the Tour.It will take a week for the first true test of the overall contenders to arrive on the seventh stage from lIsle-Jourdain to Lac de Payolle.From there on there will be four summit finishes, seven hors category climbs and 14 first category ones.Many people believe the overall battle will turn out to be a two-way struggle between Froome and Colombian Nairo Quintana, who finished second to the Briton in both 2013 and last year.",07-02-2016,Sprinters to shine at start of climbers Tour,cycling,Le Mont-Saint-Michel,Froome;Mark;Cavendish;Nairo;Mont Saint-Michel;Marcel Kittel;Chris;Le;Peter Sagan;Sagan;Kittel;Quintana;Chris Froome;Mark Cavendish;Nairo Quintana;Greipel;Mont;Andre;Mont-Saint-Michel;Saint-Michel;Le Mont-Saint-Michel;Peter;Marcel;Andre Greipel,,

"LONDON: World number one and defending champion Novak Djokovic was facing Wimbledon humiliation on Friday before rain saved him from his worst defeat at the tournament since 2008.The three-time champion, who is already halfway to the first calendar Grand Slam in 47 years, dropped the first two sets of his third round clash against American 28th seed Sam Querrey 7-6 (8/6), 6-1.But after just 73 minutes of action, rain sent them running for cover off Court One, giving 12-time major winner Djokovic welcome sanctuary before play was called off for the day on the outside courts. By that stage, only 17 of the scheduled 32 ties had been completed.Djokovic, who has an 8-1 record over Querrey, has made at least the quarter-finals on his last seven visits to Wimbledon since losing to Marat Safin in the second round eight years ago.He has also made the last eight of each of the last 28 Grand Slams since losing to Philipp Kohlschreiber in the third round of the 2009 French Open.Meanwhile, Serena and Venus Williams survived marathon duels as the rain, which has plagued the tournament, forced organisers to consider playing on the middle Sunday for the first time since 2004.World number one and defending champion Serena defeated US compatriot Christina McHale 6-7 (7/9), 6-2, 6-4 on Centre Court, only just avoiding what would have been her earliest-ever Wimbledon defeat.The six-time Wimbledon champion will face Germanys Annika Beck for a place in the last 16.",07-02-2016,Djokovic facing Wimbledon humiliation Serena Venus surviv,tennis,LONDON,Querrey;Williams;Beck;Marat;Novak;Safin;Djokovic;Philipp Kohlschreiber;Philipp;Venus Williams;Germanys Annika Beck;McHale;Annika;Sam Querrey;Christina McHale;Venus;Novak Djokovic;Marat Safin;Kohlschreiber;Sam;Serena;Christina;Germanys,Djokovic;Serena Venus;Novak Djokovic,Centre Court

"Stade de Bordeaux, Bordeaux: Germany won an epic shootout featuring 18 penalties by 6-5 to end their jinx against Italy in major tournaments and reach the Euro 2016 semi-finals after the game finished 1-1 following extra time on Saturday.Jonas Hector was Germany's hero when he fired home the winning penalty, after Matteo Darmian missed for Italy, and they will now face either hosts France or Iceland in the last four.The shootout featured seven misses with some near-farcical spot kicks and was a complete contrast to the tense, tactical and highly-disciplined 120 minutes of football that preceded it.The usually clinical Germans, who had not missed in a shootout since the 1982 World Cup, failed to convert three times but still progressed thanks to even more wayward shooting by Italy who sent two kicks wide and had two saved by Manuel Neuer.Germany, who in their semi-final on Thursday, have now won their last six shootouts at major tournaments since losing to Czechoslovakia in the 1976 European Championship final.""It's difficult to find the words. I'm overjoyed that the ball went in,"" said Hector. ""I can't describe the feeling. I took my heart in my hands and just wanted to knock it in.""Germany coach Joachim Loew added: ""I congratulated him (Hector). It was a very special situation. I had a good feeling when he was taking his (penalty) shot.""strong>BIZARRE HANDBALL</strongMesut Ozil had given Germany the lead midway through the second half before Leonardo Bonucci replied with a penalty following a bizarre handball by Jerome Boateng.Germany, who reached their sixth successive semi-final in a major tournament, had never previously beaten Italy at a major finals -- a run stretching back to the 1962 World Cup.Italy's four wins included a World Cup final and two semis and the Euro 2012 semi-final. The other four games were drawn.For Italy, the defeat was the end of the road in a campaign which has already taken them further than expected, with impressive wins over dark horses Belgium and holders Spain.Coach Antonio Conte has been credited with overcoming the lack of natural talent in his squad through tactical discipline and hard work but, with key midfielder Daniele De Rossi joining the injured list, Germany proved to be a bridge too far.""The players have left a significant mark on this tournament and shown that with desire and hard work, you can achieve something,"" said Conte.""Football can bring you joy and can leave a bad taste in your mouth. The players will always have a place in my heart.strong>TENSE START</strongThe first half was as tense, tactical and cagey as expected between teams who had conceded one goal between at these finals.Germany's passing was slicker, though, and they went ahead the 65th minute when Hector's pass into the area was deflected off Bonucci and fell perfectly for Ozil to guide into the net.It seemed that might be enough to win the game but Italy equalised out of the blue 13 minutes later.Alessandro Florenzi curled the ball into the area, Boateng jumped to challenge Giorgio Chiellini with his arms raised like a basketball player and the ball hit the German's arm.Bonucci fired a superb penalty low into the bottom right hand corner, beyond Neuer's reach.Italy suddenly found a new lease of life as striker Graziano Pelle had a shot deflected wide following a quick break and Mattia De Sciglio fired into the side-netting.Little happened in extra time but the shootout was one of the most eventful ever seen at a major tournament.Simone Zaza, who sent his kick high and wide after an unorthodox run-up, Pelle, Bonucci and Darmian missed for Italy, while Thomas Mueller, Ozil and Bastian Schweinsteiger fluffed their lines for Germany before Hector sealed the victory.",07-03-2016,Germany win epic shootout to end Italy jinx,football,Stade de Bordeaux,Zaza;Thomas Mueller;Manuel;Giorgio;Matteo Darmian;Manuel Neuer.Germany;Darmian;Joachim;Bonucci;Leonardo Bonucci;De;Pelle;Hector;Matteo;Boateng;Bastian Schweinsteiger;Loew;Graziano;Conte;Mattia De Sciglio;Bastian;Rossi;Mattia;Sciglio;Ozil;Neuer.Germany;Graziano Pelle;Jerome Boateng.Germany;Giorgio Chiellini;Daniele De Rossi;Schweinsteiger;Leonardo;Thomas;Mueller;Daniele;Chiellini;Joachim Loew;Boateng.Germany;Jerome,,Spain.Coach Antonio Conte

""I was no different, I was also aggressive, very different in terms of the way we probably came across on the field.""But you don't want to curb aggression.

"TAUNTON, United Kingdom: Mohammad Amir marked his return to cricket in England with two wickets in quick succession against Somerset at Taunton on Monday.Left-arm fast bowler Amirs exciting career came to a shuddering halt at Lords in 2010 when, during a Test against England, he and new-ball partner Mohammad Asif were caught bowling no-balls to order on the instructions of captain Salman Butt as part of a a tabloid newspaper sting operation.All three received five-year bans from cricket and jail terms.But the 24-year-old Amir is now back in England with the Pakistan squad and could make his return to Test cricket in the first of a four-match series at Lords on July 14.After Pakistan had made 359 for eight declared on the second morning of three in their tour opener, Amir took the new ball.Despite suggestions from England captain Alastair Cook that spectators might jeer Amir, there was nothing but polite applause from a modest crowd for the 24-year-old paceman.Former England opener Marcus Trescothick blocked his first ball and took two fours off Amirs opening over.But Amir struck with his 14th ball back on English soil when he produced a superb outswinger that moved late to Trescothick, then on eight, which the left-hander edged behind, with wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed holding an excellent diving catch.Amir struck again when an inswinger bowled Adam Hose.Hose, making his first-class debut and probably never having faced bowling of this quality before, was out for 10 and Somerset were 23 for two.At this staged Amir had taken two wickets for six runs in 11 balls.During Pakistans innings, there as an ironic moment when the first delivery Amir faced was a no-ball from Somerset and Scotland seamer Josh Davey.Next ball, Amir was caught behind off Davey for a duck.",07-04-2016,Mohammad Amir strikes on England retur,cricket,TAUNTON,Davey;Davey.Next;Sarfraz Ahmed;Cook;Trescothick;Alastair;Josh;Hose.Hose;Alastair Cook;Ahmed;Mohammad Asif;Mohammad Amir;Sarfraz;Amir;Butt;Mohammad;Marcus Trescothick;Asif;Adam;Marcus;Adam Hose.Hose;Josh Davey.Next;Salman;Salman Butt,Mohammad Amir,Amirs

We didn't handle it well mentally, Lagerback said in reference to that 2-0 Zagreb defeat after a goalless first leg.Its some kind of mental thing that happened to the players.

We made some silly mistakes, and we didn't do well as a team,"" added Lagerback, who is now handing over the reins completely to current partner Heimir Hallgrmsson after four-and-a-half years.""It's really impressive that the players turned it around as they did and I don't think it was because France let us do that.""They showed a bit of the real Icelandic attitude in the second half.However, Lagerback was full of pride and praise for the way the players had performed through the month, when they won one and drew two group games before shocking England in Nice.Its been a fantastic tournament so its a big thank you to everyone, said the former Sweden coach.It's been a fantastic journey for me. I've enjoyed -- maybe not the first 45 minutes today -- but all my time in Iceland and it's been a privilege to be involved.If you look at the whole tournament, and to reach the quarter-finals, its been fantastic.""Captain Aron Gunnarsson said the team had been determined to not go out on the wrong end of a thrashing.""The first half was terrible but the second half we played better,"" he said.

"BRISTOL: Tammy Beaumont and Lauren Winfield produced another dazzling opening partnership of 147 - England Women's highest stand in T20s - to set up a 68-run victory in the first T20 at Bristol.Beaumont made 82 off 53 balls and Winfield 74 off 45 to lead England to their highest total in the format. It followed their 235-run opening stand in the second ODI at New Road when they both hit centuries.Beaumont reached her fifty off 30 balls, and having moved to 82 with nearly five overs remaining had time to score England's first T20I century before falling lbw as she attempted a reverse-sweep, meaning Charlotte Edwards' unbeaten 92, against Australia at Hobart, remained Englands best.Like Beaumont, Winfield struck 10 fours and also a six off Sadia Yousuf and her final score equalled her career-best, having also made 74 against South Africa in 2014.At 146 for 0 in 15 overs, 200 was within reach for England but the last five overs were not quite as fluent as the first 15. The 16-20-over block had fewer runs - 41 - than the other five-over breakdowns.The final over included a team hat-trick for Pakistan as Nat Sciver edged a swipe, Danni Wyatt was run out and Heather Knight feathered a reverse-sweep to the keeper.A target of 189 was, unsurprisingly, well out of reach for Pakistan and England's bowling was not stretched in defending the target. Four of the wickets fell to full-tosses, the third of them giving 17-year-old debutant Sophie Ecclestone, a left-arm spinner, her first international wicket when Sidra Ameen picked out deep midwicket.Asmavia Iqbal struck some powerful blows to finish as top-scorer -- including the one six of the innings, which was Pakistan's first of the tour - before being bowled by Danielle Hazell in the final over.",07-04-2016,Beaumont Winfield whirlwinds flatten Pakistan W,cricket,BRISTOL,Nat;Danni;Danielle;Charlotte;Ameen;Winfield;Heather Knight;Sciver;Yousuf;Knight;Lauren Winfield;Sidra Ameen;Ecclestone;Wyatt;Sidra;Tammy;Charlotte Edwards;Heather;Sophie;Danni Wyatt;Lauren;Sophie Ecclestone;Hazell;Nat Sciver;Sadia;Tammy Beaumont;Beaumont;Edwards;Danielle Hazell;Sadia Yousuf,,Winfield
"TAUNTON, United Kingdom: England captain Alastair Cook believes Pakistans Mohammad Amir will face a tough reception from fans should he return to Test cricket at Lords later this month.Left-arm fast bowler Amirs exciting career came to a shuddering halt at Lords in 2010 when, during a Test against England, he and new-ball partner Mohammad Asif were caught bowling no-balls to order on the instructions of captain Salman Butt as part of a sting operation carried out by a tabloid newspaper.All three received five-year bans from cricket and, together with sports agent Mazhar Majeed, jail terms.Amir, who served three months in an English young offenders institute, has only featured in the games shorter formats since his return to Pakistan duty in January.But the 24-year-olds career could come full circle when the first of a four-Test series against England starts at Lords on July 14.Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq has backed Amir, currently playing in the teams opening tour match against Somerset in Taunton, to become the best bowler in the world.But Cook says he will likely have to deal with some taunts from spectators first.""Im sure there will be a reaction and that is right,"" said Cook at a sponsors event.""That is part and parcel, that when you do something like that there are more consequences than just the punishment -- that is something for him to cope with, whatever comes his way.""Opening batsman Cook, who played in the controversial 2010 Lords Test, added: ""It wont affect us as a side, we will concentrate on what we can concentrate on.""The media will ask questions about it but it will not affect us.""strong>- One strike -</strongMeanwhile Cook reiterated his call for future fixers to be hit with life-bans while saying he had no qualms about playing against Amir again.""Whether I agreed or disagreed with the punishment, he got it, served his time and he is absolutely right to come back.""Youd have to speak to him. What he did wasnt good, but he served his punishment then.""It hasnt happened and the ICC (International Cricket Council) havent made any big statements, but if I was in charge if you got caught once that would be it - one strike and youre out.""England paceman Stuart Broad made his highest Test score of 169 during the now infamous match at Lords, an innings that was quickly overshadowed by the spot-fixing furore.However, Broad told Britains Mail on Sunday newspaper: ""In Amirs case I certainly have no hard feelings about playing against him again.""What he did was wrong but he was extremely young and maybe not aware of the consequences. The reality is hes back in the game and has served his time.""Broad added: ""I have a little bit of sympathy for Amir but once youve received money to do something illegal that is always a bad thing.""We are very well-educated by the ICCs anti-corruption unit, but at 18 years old you are potentially more vulnerable and susceptible to your elders.""Broad, however, agreed with Cook that life bans were the best deterrent to spot and match-fixing.""I am strongly of the view that one of the only ways we will ever expel this awful disease from our game is to hand out lifetime bans for any kind of fixing,"" said Broad.",07-04-2016,England captain expects rough ride Mohammad Amir,cricket,TAUNTON,Cook;Alastair;Mazhar Majeed;Stuart Broad;Misbah-ul-Haq;Alastair Cook;Mohammad Asif;Majeed;Mohammad Amir;Mazhar;Amir;Butt;Mohammad;Asif;Stuart;Broad;Salman;Salman Butt,Mohammad Amir,International Cricket Council;ICC;Britains Mail

"LONDON: Serena Williams made the most of a break in her match against 13th seed Svetlana Kuznetsova on Monday, when the Centre Court roof was closed after she threatened to sue organisers if she fell and injured herself on the slippery turf.The world number one, who subsequently made light of the threat, began as if late for an Independence Day appointment, serving a succession of aces and then hitting a brace of groundstroke winners to break her opponent in the fourth game.Bidding to equal Steffi Graf's professional-era record of 22 grand slam titles, Williams failed to keep up the momentum and found herself 5-4 down when the Russian broke with a crosscourt backhand winner that left the American sprawled on the ground.But the Russian, herself a double grand slam winner and three-times Wimbledon quarter-finalist, failed to serve out the set.With drizzle imminent, a ballboy losing his footing and both players complaining about the slippery conditions -- and with Williams threatening to sue if she got injured -- the match was suspended at 5-5 for the roof to be closed.After the encounter the American said the comment was not meant seriously.""What I say on the court, whether it's smashing my rackets, it's in the heat of the moment,"" said the American, who picked up a $10,000 fine for racket abuse in an earlier match at the tournament.""I have no plans, no future of suing Wimbledon. Let's get serious. That's not what I do.""strong>COOLING OFF</strongAs well as having a chance to cool off, Williams was able to refocus her game with coach Patrick Mouratoglou and did not drop a single game after play resumed.""I had a little time to think about it and just calm down...

He gave me some tips on what I could do,"" she said.Kuznetsova beat Williams on a hardcourt at the Miami Open in March and, prior to the break, was more than holding her own. She frustrated the American by varying her pace well and mixing in slices and dropshots.Whatever words of wisdom Mouratoglou imparted, the six-times Wimbledon champion was too hot to handle after the break, reeling off the last eight games in a 7-5 6-0 win.The number one seed faces another Russian, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, in the quarter-finals, where she was joined for the first time since 2010 by older sister Venus.""It's great,"" the younger Williams said.

"PARIS: One is an ""Eau de toilette"" kind of character, the other more ""wake up and smell the coffee"".Cristiano Ronaldo is immaculately groomed, makes a point of posing for the cameras when he scores, is often captured scowling at his colleagues and recently launched his own men's fragrance called ""Legacy"".Gareth Bale is constantly encouraging his team mates and is described by his manager as ""the most down-to-earth boy you could meet.""The world's two most expensive footballers, who play alongside each other at Real Madrid, will go head-to-head when Bale's Wales meet Ronaldo's Portugal in their Euro 2016 semi-final in Lyon on Wednesday.In playing terms, both are the leaders of their teams but they take very different approaches to their role.While Bale is widely acclaimed as an inspiration for his national team, Ronaldo's influence on Portugal is the subject of debate.Ronaldo's team mates routinely leap to his defence and emphasise that he is always working for them.""Cristiano has worked for the squad and it's the only the squad which matters here,"" said midfielder Andre Gomes.""Maybe people were expecting more goals, (but) he has made a huge contribution to the national team and it's not the moment to start questioning a player.""Coach Fernando Santos added that Ronaldo has sacrificed himself for the team.""He is an example, as captain, of the spirit of this team, of this team's determination, he wants to do well and he wants to win, in this aspect he has been fantastic. He's an example of what the team is,"" he said.Even so, the 31-year-old three-times World Player-of-the-Year has often struggled with an image problem, especially when he said two years ago that Portugal needed ""two or three Cristiano Ronaldos.""He insists on taking every free kick within - and often beyond - shooting distance, prompting suggestions that he is selfish, and is regularly captured on television cameras remonstrating angrily with his team mates.Nani, a veteran of more than 100 caps, is invariably berated if he dares to try a shot rather than feed the ball to the ""senior partner.""Earlier in the tournament Ronaldo threw a reporter's microphone into a lake when he was asked a question during a team walk and was criticised for disparaging remarks he made about Iceland after Portugal drew 1-1 with the rank outsiders in their opening match.He has not even turned up at any of the daily press conferences which Portugal hold at their camp.Bale, in comparison, has taken part in at least four, looks relaxed, and is not afraid to stir up some controversy such as when he said that no England players would get into the Wales side, adding that Wales were more passionate than their larger neighbours.Television images tend to show him encouraging his team mates rather than gesticulating angrily and complaining.They are obviously different types of people and different characters, said Wales manager Chris Coleman.Whatever Bale brings to the table for us, that's him. He's not manufactured. He doesn't try to be something he's not.Gareth is clearly a special player. For us he is special, not just because of his talent but what he represents when he plays for Wales.He appreciates what he has around him and they appreciate they have a super talent.

"Taunton: Marcus Trescothick warned Englands batsmen to expect a tough time in the middle facing Mohammad Amir after he became the Pakistanis maiden first-class wicket on English soil in six years on Monday.Amir took three for 36 in 11 overs in Pakistans opening match of their England tour against Somerset at Taunton.Somerset slumped to 128 all out in reply to Pakistans first innings 359 for eight declared -- a deficit of 231 runs.Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq opted against enforcing the follow-on and at stumps, on the second day of three, the tourists were 140 for four for in their second innings -- a huge lead of 371 runs.Azhar Ali was 50 not out and Asad Shafiq 26 not out.<br/>Amirs exciting career came to a shuddering halt during a Lords Test in 2010 when he and new-ball partner Mohammad Asif were caught bowling no-balls to order on the instructions of captain Salman Butt as part of a tabloid newspaper sting operation.All three received five-year bans from cricket and together with sports agent Mazhar Majeed, jail terms.Amir, who served three months in an English young offenders institute, has only featured in the games shorter formats since his return to Pakistan duty in January.But the 24-year-old is now back in England and could make his Test return in the first of a four-match series at Lords on July 14.The floppy hair he had as a teenager may have been replaced by a shorter haircut and a goatee beard, but the whippy action that made Amir one of crickets hottest properties was still on show at south-west county Somersets headquarters ground.After Pakistan had declared on Monday morning following a century by Younis Khan, Amir took the new ball.Trescothick took two fours off Amirs opening over. But Amir struck with his 14th ball back in first-class cricket on English soil.Left-hander Trescothick, on eight, could only edge a superb outswinger that moved late and wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed held an excellent diving catch.Amir had another wicket when a full-length inswinger bowled first-class debutant Adam Hose (10).And eight minutes after lunch, Amir bowled Peter Trego (23) with another fine inswinger that knocked over the batsmans middle stump and left the other two standing.""He bowled very well,"" said the 40-year-old Trescothick, whose nine-balls faced on Monday were all bowled by Amir, after stumps.""He swung the ball really late, thats the biggest thing we noticed.<br/>""In my magnificent eight I thought it was pretty hard work, it was tricky,"" added Trescothick, who in 76 Tests from 2000-2006 scored 5,825 runs at an average of nearly 44 with 14 hundreds./><strong>Guessing</strong""You get a lot of bowlers who swing it quite early but he (Amir) was swinging it late and as it was coming down the pitch you were almost guessing whether it was an inswinger or whether it was one of the straight ones,"" the Somerset stalwart explained.Trescothick was in no doubt that, on this form, Amir could threaten Englands current top order.""On that performance yes he will cause problems for England. ""He got Adam Hose with a good inswinger round the wicket and Pete Trego got an absolute beauty.""That bit of extra pace is the thing. He hasnt played international cricket for a number of years so theres probably an extra bit of zip that he has that makes him hard work.""Despite suggestions from England captain Alastair Cook that spectators might jeer Amir, there was nothing but polite applause as he came on to bowl in Taunton.""I dont think youd expect anything else,"" said Trescothick. ""We get on and play the game and it is what it is.""Meanwhile Pakistan opener Shan Masood said of Amir: ""He hasnt lost it. If anything, hes just got better.""England swept aside Sri Lanka 2-0 in a three-match Test series and have an impressive home record.""We have to respect England, how good they are ... but were up for it,"" insisted Masood.""Were ready to come to England and give them a good match.""",07-05-2016,Trescothick issues Amir warning,cricket,Taunton,Younis Khan;Shan Masood;Trescothick;Shafiq;Younis;Mazhar Majeed;Pete Trego;Masood;Hose;Mohammad Asif;Majeed;Mohammad Amir;Butt;Adam;Marcus;Peter Trego;Shan;Sarfraz Ahmed;Cook;Khan;Alastair;Asad Shafiq;Misbah-ul-Haq;Alastair Cook;Ahmed;Pete;Mazhar;Sarfraz;Amir;Asad;Mohammad;Marcus Trescothick;Asif;Salman;Trego;Salman Butt;Peter;Adam Hose;Ali,Trescothick;Amir;Marcus Trescothick;Mohammad Amir,Taunton.Somerset;Amirs;Somerset
"Paralympic gold medallist Oscar Pistorius will not appeal a six-year prison sentence given by a South African High Court judge on Wednesday for the 2013 murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, his defence team said.Pistorius will serve ""between half and two thirds of the sentence"" before he can apply for parole, said Andrew Fawcett, Pistorius' instructing attorney.Pistorius was sent to prison for six years on Wednesday for the 2013 murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, the latest twist in a trial that has gripped the world.The state and large sections of the South African public had called for him to receive no less than the prescribed minimum 15-year sentence for murder, saying Pistorius had shown no remorse for the killing.Judge Thokozile Masipa disagreed, accepting the defence's arguments for a lesser punishment.""Public opinion may be loud and persistent but it can play no role in the decision of this court,"" Masipa said. ""I am of the view that a long term in prison will not serve justice.""It was not clear whether the state would appeal the verdict.Dressed in a dark suit, the 29-year-old stared straight ahead as Masipa read out the sentence.Pistorius was found guilty of murdering Steenkamp by an appeals court last December.

The sentence can be appealed through the Spanish supreme court, the statement said.However, under Spanish law a prison sentence under two years can be served under probation, meaning Messi and his father are unlikely to go to jail.The court ordered Messi to pay a fine of around 2 million euros ($2.21 million) and his father to pay 1.5 million euros for the crimes.",07-06-2016,Barcelona soccer star Messi sentenced to 21 months in pri,football,BARCELONA,Lionel Messi;Messi;Jorge;Lionel,Messi;Lionel Messi,Barcelona;BARCELONA

"EVIAN: Germany coach Joachim Loew has been forced to make changes to his team for Thursday's semi-final against hosts France at Euro 2016 because of injuries and a suspension, including replacing key goalscorer Mario Gomez.Gomez, whose two goals helped the world champions to the last four, has been forced out of the rest of the tournament with a pulled hamstring. Holding midfielder Sami Khedira will also miss the clash because of a groin injury.Central defender Mats Hummels completes the trio of absentees, sitting out the game due to suspension following a second booking in the Germans' quarter-final victory over Italy on penalties.Chasing a fourth European title, Germany could also be without Bastian Schweinsteiger. Loew has ruled out using his captain unless he has recovered fully from a knee ligament injury.The German boss has to decide what to do with his forward line and whether to use Mario Goetze, Lukas Podolski, Thomas Mueller or Leroy Sane. Goetze and Mueller have both been struggling with their form.In defence Loew is unlikely to deploy a three-man central defence as he did against Italy.""Against France I still have to think about it. Italy are a team with automated plays. They are world class in playing them but they are predictable,"" Loew told reporters.""France are different. They constantly change positions, they are much more unexpected and difficult to predict.""Loew is likely to use Emre Can as Khedira's replacement with Benedikt Hoewedes slipping into the central defence for Hummels.The French are feeling confident following their 5-2 demolition of Iceland and the euphoria in the country is growing. But, in order to reach a home final in Paris on July 10, Didier Deschamp's team must plug their porous defence.Leading 4-0 at halftime against Iceland, France dropped their guard, conceding two goals. Centre back Samuel Umtiti, playing his first international, was not totally commanding and Adil Rami, who was suspended, could return for the German game.Rami, however, has shown signs of nerves on several occasions, as has left back Patrice Evra, leaving France's defence looking vulnerable, notably from set pieces.""We're looking better but Germany remains Germany,"" said Deschamps, whose side lost to the eventual winners in the 2014 World Cup quarter-finals as well as suffering painful semi-final defeats to the Germans at the 1982 and 1986 World Cups.""They are the best team in Europe and in the world and the only ones totally controlling the situation, with technical quality everywhere, from the goalkeeper to the forwards,"" said the coach.""We'll fight for our chances, knowing what we are up against.""",07-06-2016,Germany forced to make key changes for semi fi,football,EVIAN,Sami Khedira;Sane;Thomas Mueller;Patrice Evra;Deschamp;Rami;Mario;Samuel;Mats;Didier;Hoewedes;Joachim;Adil Rami;Umtiti;Podolski;Mario Gomez.Gomez;Sami;Bastian Schweinsteiger;Loew;Didier Deschamp;Adil;Bastian;Deschamps;Mats Hummels;Lukas Podolski;Leroy Sane;Patrice;Goetze;Gomez.Gomez;Khedira;Schweinsteiger;Benedikt;Thomas;Evra;Mueller;Mario Goetze;Hummels;Samuel Umtiti;Benedikt Hoewedes;Joachim Loew;Lukas;Leroy,,

"Marseille: More than 15,000 Germany fans led the latest Euro 2016 invasion of Marseille on Thursday ahead of their countrys key semi-final clash against France, while excitement built in the host nation.After Cristiano Ronaldos Portugal beat Wales 2-0 to seal their place in Sundays final, attention now turns to see which of the two tournament favourites can reach the Stade de France in Paris for Sundays final.Football fever rose as temperatures hit 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) in the Mediterranean city. But after the trauma of clashes between Russian and England fans earlier in the tournament, German and French fans packed bars and cafes in a calm atmosphere.Many cars in Marseille were decked out in French tricolour flags with children, their faces painted, wearing France caps.""Day of glory,"" trumpeted the front page of LEquipe newspaper over a picture of the French team congratulating star midfielder Paul Pogba on scoring a goal.Neither country has announced a team for the match, which starts at 1900 GMT, but Germanys Joachim Loew said that captain Bastian Schweinsteiger was fit to start after an injury scare in the penalty shootout win over Italy.""In a game like this, his experience is very valuable and, in any case, he will start,"" Loew said Wednesday.strong>- Misers and hot shots -</strongThe European Championship hosts will be looking to beat Germany, the World Cup holders, in a major tournament for the first time in 58 years.Germany have triumphed in three World Cup encounters since then, the last in the 2014 quarter-finals. Their most famous meeting was the 1982 semi-final when Frances Patrick Battiston had to be revived by medics on the pitch after a brutal clash with German goalkeeper Harald Schumacher.Bayern Munichs Manuel Neuer, the most miserly goalkeeper in the tournament, and Atletico Madrid striker Griezmann as leading scorer could hold the key to their latest encounter however.Griezmann scored two of his four goals in Frances impressive 5-2 quarter-final win over Iceland.Neuer has conceded only one goal in regulation time in five games -- a spot-kick against Italy in the quarter-finals, a tie Germany won on penalties.""We need to score goals. This is a team that doesnt concede a lot of goals,"" said France coach Didier Deschamps.""Everyone talks about their attack, but they know how to defend,"" he added.Loew is aware of the French threat.""We are going to have to be compact and close down the space in defence,"" he said.""France are going to be the toughest opponents we have had in the tournament until now.""Deschamps has no injury problems and welcomes back midfielder NGolo Kante and defender Adil Rami to contend for places after both served suspensions against Iceland.With many French fans looking back to the 1982 battle, Deschamps said: ""We cant change past history, but weve got our own page to write.""Apart from the return of Schweinsteiger, Loew gave no other team details and he faces tough choices.Centre-back Mats Hummels picked up a yellow card and is suspended. Striker Mario Gomez and midfielder Sami Khedira picked up injuries which ruled them out and made Schweinsteigers presence even more essential.Bayern man Thomas Mueller, normally a regular source of goals for Germany, has yet to score at the tournament.But Mueller said reaching the final and getting a chance to add the Euro trophy to the World Cup title won in 2014 is all that matters.""Reaching that goal is what drives me on.

"ULAANBAATAR: Nine-year-old Mongolian schoolgirl Suvd-Erdene spends four hours a day perfecting the art of doing a head-stand on a pole clenched with her teeth and push-ups without her feet touching the ground.She and about a dozen team mates are training in a basement in the capital, Ulaanbaatar, to be contortionists; a revered art that Mongolians say was developed in the palace of 13th century warlord and national hero Genghis Khan.Usually performed by females, the discipline involves twisting and stretching the body to the extreme.The diminutive Suvd-Erdene makes the moves look easy having completed years of grueling training that began with intensive stretching exercises when she was six.""I cried when my teacher made me do the stretching exercises, at that time I felt really discouraged,"" she told Reuters.The girls are given time off school to train down a drab Ulaanbaatar back street under the guidance of 22-year-old Urangoo, a third generation contortionist.Urangoo took up training young contortionists after her own hopes of hitting the big time and performing abroad ended when she suffered an injury at the age of 12.Mongolian contortionists are in high demand and performers may be vaulted into an international career if they are lucky enough to be spotted by scouts from theatrical producers like Cirque du Soleil.For Suvd-Erdene's team mate Shinezul, becoming a contortionist is also a matter of national pride.""Its the Mongolian peoples dream to introduce Mongolian national culture and art to the whole world, so thats why I want to be the best contortionist in the world,"" she said.",07-07-2016,Mongolian girl contortionists stretch international su,contortion,ULAANBAATAR,Suvd-Erdene;Shinezul;Cirque;Genghis Khan.Usually;Khan.Usually;Genghis,,
"TAUNTON, United Kingdom: As a left-arm fast bowler, Mohammad Amir is often compared to Pakistan predecessor Wasim Akram.But having seen Amir close up during Pakistans opening match of their England tour, Somerset coach Matthew Maynard was struck by a likeness to a fast bowler from an earlier generation than Akram in 1970s West Indies great Andy Roberts.As well as sheer speed, right-armer Roberts was known for his ability to bowl a second bouncer that was markedly quicker than the first one a batsman had received from the Antiguan.They may have very different delivery actions, but having witnessed Amir mark his return to first-class cricket in England with three for 36 in Somersets first innings, Maynard was clear the 24-year-old had something of Robertss bowling intelligence about him.And this despite Amir having only recently returned from a five-year ban and jail sentence imposed for his part in bowling deliberate no balls as part of a tabloid newspaper sting during the 2010 Test between England and Pakistan at Lords.""He was swinging it massive in the first innings, proper late big swing,"" said former England batsman Maynard of Amir.""Hes a threat, he always has been, hasnt he? Hes got that pace, hes wiry, hes got a change-up, you dont see that too often these days,"" he added.""Hes someone who almost bowls at 90 percent, 95 percent of his capabilities and then he throws that 100 percenter in, that change of pace up, like the old great Andy Roberts,"" explained the 50-year-old Maynard.""We dont see that as often these days,"" said Maynard, with Amir in line to make his Test return at, of all places, Lords where a four-match series with England starts on July 14.The Somerset coach also had words of praise for Pakistan leg-spinner Yasir Shah, returning to first-class cricket after several months out serving a drugs ban for taking a masking agent.Shah almost bowled Pakistan to victory at Taunton by taking four for 107 in 32 overs as Somerset clung on for a draw on Tuesdays final day of three.""Yasir Shah, first outing what for six months or so in this game? He hardly bowled a bad ball, he was getting his fingers round it as the spell developed on a wicket that was pretty unresponsive for him, he looks a class act,"" said Maynard.strong>- Quality line-up -</strongPakistan boast a powerful middle order featuring captain Misbah-ul-Haq and fellow veteran stroke-maker Younis Khan.Maynard said that if Pakistans openers -- who were Mohammad Hafeez and Shan Masood at Somerset -- could get through the opening overs from Englands James Anderson and Stuart Broad, the team could yet spring a surprise.""Their openers potentially, if they sort that out, if they can get off to good starts, Im sure they will get enough runs on the board.""We know that Pakistan have always had a quality bowling line-up. They learn to bowl on good true wickets and the skills that they develop are terrific.""I think England are in a brilliant place as a team at the moment. They are playing good, positive cricket, aggressive with the bat and likewise aggressive and disciplined with the ball. I think it will be a great series.""Somerset stalwart Marcus Trescothick may have been out for eight in the first innings, but the 40-year-old former England opener, who could easily have chosen to miss this match, made 106 in the southwest countys second innings.""At the end of the day, when you get a senior player like Marcus who does what he does, not only with the bat but with the intensity he runs between the wickets, he loves the game and that rubs off, thats such a powerful tool,"" said Maynard.""Whatever we say as coaches pales into insignificance when youve got a peer who goes about his business like Marcus...

"Australian fast bowler Josh Hazlewood has voiced his support to Ricky Ponting's suggestion that restrictions must be imposed on bat sizes in test cricket to negate an unfair advantage for the men at the crease.Former Australia skipper Ponting, raised concerns about the rising imbalance between bat and ball, adding that the topic of imposing bat size limits would be discussed when the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) World Cricket Committee met next week.A report commissioned by the MCC in 2014 found the thickness of bats had marginally increased in the last century and that edges had broadened by 300 percent, meaning mistimed shots could still find the boundary.However, with restrictions yet to be imposed on bat sizes by the World Cricket Committee, Hazlewood said applying such rules would be a positive move.""I'm all for it,"" the 25-year-old told reporters. ""Some of those cricket bats going around the dressing sheds at the moment are unbelievably big.""Obviously (Australia opener) David Warner, and (top order batsman) Usman Khawaja has got a few big ones as well. I'm all for it.""Hazlewood, a member of the 2015 World Cup winning squad, added that any rule change should be applied to the longest version of the game, rather than to curb the excitement of the one-day format.""I think he's (Ponting) made a good point about just in test matches,"" Hazlewood added.""One-day cricket (is) a little bit different, I think the crowds come to see the fours and sixes and big hits.

"LONDON: Roger Federer put his global army of ""Fed-Head"" fans through the wringer for four nerve-shredding sets before he kept alive his pursuit of a record eighth Wimbledon title with a 6-7(4) 4-6 6-3 7-6(9) 6-3 win over Marin Cilic the quarter-finals on Wednesday.Novak Djokovic's shock third round exit had raised hopes that this could be the week when the Swiss finally ends his four-year hunt for an 18th grand slam title, as the Serb had been the only man to beat him at the majors over the past year.However, all those expectations appeared to be heading for the dustbin as Cilic stood one point away from victory -- not once, not twice but three times in a pulsating fourth set that had everyone on the edge of their seats.Three huge serves kept Federer alive -- just -- and he then produced the kind of form, and outrageous shots, that has made him the most successful man in tennis by stealing the tiebreak 11-9.An ace on his first match point finished off the job after three hours, 17 minutes of high drama and carried him into an 11th Wimbledon semi-final, and 40th overall in the majors.""I knew I was in so much trouble in the third and again in the fourth,"" Federer said after walking off Centre Court to a standing ovation.""It wasn't going well for me. So for me it was about staying in the match and somehow hope for his level to drop ... and maybe get a bit lucky. That's exactly what happened at 3-3, 0-40 (in the third set),"" added Federer about the game where he saved three break points.""Obviously the breaker was crazy. It was an incredible match. Marin is one of the nicest guys on the tour so I feel sorry for him but for me the dream continues.""The win also made him the most successful player, man or woman, at the majors as he chalked up a record 307th singles win.""I cannot believe Roger Federer won that match. How did he get out of that?"" gushed American great John McEnroe.""You've got to love the courage that he is able to find a way to do that, that is a killer loss.""Having missed last month's French Open with a back injury, the five set thriller also delivered a knockout punch to those thinking the Swiss third seed did not have the stamina to last the distance.""It's really encouraging for me to see that I am improving.

"LYON: Cristiano Ronaldo scored one goal and inadvertently set up the other as Portugal ground out a 2-0 win over Wales on Wednesday to march into the Euro 2016 final.The Portuguese superstar, who has had to soak up a lot of criticism for a lacklustre tournament by his high standards, majestically powered in a 50th-minute header to put his side in front.The goal, his third in the tournament, equalled Michel Platini's record of nine in European Championship finals.Ronaldo also saw his shot turned in by Nani for a second goal in the 53rd minute, ending Wales' remarkable run at their first major finals since 1958.Portugal, who had not won a single game in the tournament over 90 minutes, next meet hosts France or Germany who play their semi-final on Thursday.""I hope that after the final we will be smiling and that it will be tears of joy in the end,"" said Ronaldo who wept after his team lost to surprise packages Greece in the 2004 final.""I have always said my dream was to win a trophy with Portugal. We are closer to doing it and I believe we will win,"" he told reporters after coming out on top in his battle with Real Madrid team mate Gareth Bale.Wales kept their opponents quiet in the first half but could not recover the two-goal deficit, ending a scintillating run that has captivated millions back home and turned their players into heroes.The Welsh, with midfielder Aaron Ramsey suspended and replaced by Leicester City's Premier League winner Andy King, had an early spell of possession but a tight Portugal defence kept them at bay.strong>FIRST CHANCE</strongPortugal, bidding to reach their first Euro final since losing on home soil 12 years ago, had their first chance after a quarter of an hour following a low drive by Joao Mario.Wales responded as Joe Ledley found Bale with a low corner and the forward fired over the bar.The Welsh, playing their first major tournament semi-final, did not suffer from stage fright with their back line, supported by midfielders Ledley and Joe Allen, disciplined and compact.In a cagey first half Portugal struggled to find Ronaldo, opting for long crosses into the box that were easy pickings for central defender James Collins.Portugal injected some urgency after the break, pressing high up the field.It paid off instantly with a corner in the 50th minute that Raphael Guerreiro floated in towards the far post where Ronaldo climbed high above two defenders to score.Portugal doubled the lead when Nani slid in to connect with Ronaldo's mishit shot, netting his own third goal of Euro 2016.Wales were lucky not to concede more goals late in the game as Portugal, now unbeaten in 13 competitive matches, continued to dream of a maiden top-notch trophy.""We are massively disappointed obviously but we have given everything on and off the pitch,"" said Wales talisman Bale.

"MARSEILLE:> When France meet Portugal in Sunday's Euro 2016 final, the outcome is likely to depend on the performances of Cristiano Ronaldo and Antoine Griezmann -- the second time the two players have clashed with a European trophy at stake in six weeks.Portugal's Ronaldo steered Real Madrid to their Champions League triumph at the end of May after his French rival Griezmann missed a penalty for city rivals Atletico.The France striker has certainly bounced back from that disappointment. He is the competition's top scorer with six goals, having scored both goals in Thursday's defeat of world champions Germany.Portugal's master tactician Fernando Santos needs to cut supply lines to a player whom the French call ""Monsieur Griezmann"" as a sign of respect -- despite his boyish looks.It will be a challenge.While Portugal saw off Wales, the Welsh playmaker Gareth Bale was still given enough space to create chances and were outdone more by the absence of midfield creativity than by Portuguese prowess.That will not be the case for France who have a larger arsenal. Even if Portugal can snuff out Griezmann, Dmitiri Payet, the stand-out performer in the earlier rounds, can change a game in seconds.Front man Olivier Giroud has also proved a handful by weighing on defences and making space for those around him.strong>TEAM SPIRIT</strongWhat has worked for Portugal has been an incredible team spirit with a mantra that they are not playing to look pretty, but to win, irrespective of style.Santos has fashioned a well-drilled 4-4-2 and kept to it throughout despite injuries. The loss of Pepe at the back was hardly noticeable against Wales with Bruno Alves stepping in admirably.From France's match with Germany, Santos will have noted that Didier Deschamps' team has a weakness on its flanks, in particular on the left with Patrice Evra.The Germans pushed the French very deep by using their full backs almost as wingers. For much of the match, France's midfield duo of Paul Pogba and Blaise Matudi chased shadows, leaving Joshua Kimmich and Jonas Hector with acres of space.Portugal's full backs Raphael Guerreiro and Cedric Soares are good enough to replicate that, which could push Deschamps to move away from the more attacking 4-2-3-1 formation to revert to a 4-3-3, restoring defensive midfielder N'Golo Kante.But whether the Portuguese midfield has the capacity of a Bastian Schweinsteiger or Toni Kroos to stifle France is questionable.strong>NO DEPENDENCY ON RONALDO</strongDanilo, who replaced William Carvalho against Wales, was strong and efficient in the holding midfield role, but has limits going forward.Joao Mario and Adrien Silva do not appear to have the killer pass for Ronaldo or strike partner Nani. That may open the door for playmaker Joao Moutinho to return.What has been evident with this Portugal side is that they are no longer a side entirely dependent on Ronaldo. On the contrary, when he goes missing, others shine.In the quarter-final against Poland, 18-year-old Renato Sanches took the plaudits, while Nani has netted three times.Portugal's most high-profile player may have three goals, but his Real Madrid explosiveness has been absent. He has had to fit into Santos' team ethos, playing a less glamorous role. Captain Ronaldo tracks back and encourages his teammates.Arguably by being quiet he may prove more lethal. France's defenders can not fall into the sleepy rhythm Portugal have set during the tournament because Ronaldo has enough to turn the tide as his majestic header against Wales showed.",07-08-2016,Griezmann and Ronaldo clash in final for second time in six ,football,MARSEILLE,Moutinho;Bale;Matudi;Monsieur;Paul Pogba;Renato Sanches;Mario;Joshua Kimmich;Cedric Soares;Didier;Antoine;Dmitiri Payet;Cristiano;Raphael Guerreiro;Joshua;Payet;Silva;Giroud;Hector;Antoine Griezmann;William;Bastian Schweinsteiger;Toni;William Carvalho;Fernando Santos;Santos;Griezmann;Bruno Alves;Cedric;Bastian;Didier Deschamps;Adrien Silva;Alves;Guerreiro;Deschamps;Raphael;Adrien;Ronaldo;Toni Kroos;N'Golo;Joao Moutinho;Cristiano Ronaldo;Gareth Bale;Patrice;Paul;RONALDO;Bruno;Olivier Giroud;Carvalho;Gareth;Blaise;Jonas;Schweinsteiger;Jonas Hector;Kimmich;Dmitiri;Nani;Pepe;Joao;Renato;Sanches;Soares;Fernando;Blaise Matudi;Olivier;Kroos;Pogba;Monsieur Griezmann,Ronaldo;Griezmann;Cristiano Ronaldo;Antoine Griezmann;Monsieur Griezmann,Real Madrid

"SEOUL: South Korean swimming star Park Tae-Hwan, who was barred from the Olympics for doping, will compete for the national team in Rio after the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) ruled in his favour.The multiple Olympic medallist had sought ""an urgent ruling"" from the Lausanne-based body against his doping ban by July 8 -- the deadline for South Korea to select their Rio swimming team.""We will include Park Tae-Hwan in the list of national athletes who will take part in the Rio Olympics"", Korean Olympic Committee (KOC) Secretary General Cho Young-Ho was quoted as saying by Yonhap news agency.Park, 26, was slapped with an 18-month suspension after testing positive for an anabolic steroid in out-of-competition controls before the 2014 Asian Games.The ban lapsed in April, but Park remained barred from the 2016 Olympics under a KOC rule which prohibits athletes from representing the country for three years after a doping ban expires.CAS ruled Friday that KOCs extended ban constituted a double jeopardy for Park and should be nullified, according to KOC.South Koreas Olympic committee had said earlier Friday it would abide by the CAS ruling.Park -- once the poster boy of South Korean swimming before the doping scandal -- has repeatedly begged for a chance to compete in what would be his third, and probably last, Olympics.He won 400m freestyle gold and 200m freestyle silver at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and two silver medals at the 2012 London Olympics, as well as 400m world titles in 2007 and 2011.",07-08-2016,Swimming S Korea to include Park for Rio Olympi,swimming,SEOUL,Tae-Hwan;Park Tae-Hwan;Cho;Young-Ho;Park;Cho Young-Ho,,Yonhap;CAS;Park Tae-Hwan;KOC

"CHELMSFORD: A fifth won toss in six and Heather Knight had no qualms batting first: England had won all 11 previous matches at Chelmsford and, with that in mind, Tammy Beaumont and Lauren Winfield ensured a 12th was sewn up early with an opening stand of 108.Across the six matches, the first England wicket has been worth 801 - more than half of their team's runs. When Pakistan do return to their own beds, a few of their bowlers might want to check under them to ensure Beaumont and Winfield are nowhere to be seen. Both their half-centuries were typical of their play over the last month: Winfield willing and on the front foot, Beaumont wristy and devastating.The familiarity spread right throughto the game's conclusion. Pakistan were run ragged in the field and, facing a total they had no intention of chasing -Danni Wyatt pilfered 11 from the first four balls of the final over to help England set 170 -it was just a matter or whether they would be bowled out in the allotted time. In the end, they finished seven wickets down and 57 short.England rang changes with the ball, the most noticeable being left-armer Tash Farrant coming in for Katherine Brunt. Having made her debut at the age of 17, Farrant spent two years on the sidelines from January 2014 to February 2016, when Mark Robinson gave her a run out in England's final T20I before the World T20.Hers is an example he was keen to address: a player picked young yet too young to cope with being dropped and overlooked for a prolongedperiod. Now 20, she lookedat ease, cycling through her variations and even nabbing the wicket of opener Nahida Khan with a slower ball that wasflat-batted back to her. There were first international wickets, too, for Alex Hartley.Talking about how easy you find things is one of cricket's great taboos, but even Heather Knight, a measured individual who seems to cringe at her own success, might wonder what all the fuss of captaining your country is about.From the early part of Robinson's tenure as head coach, it was evident that both he and Knight were on the same page. In one of their first coach-player interactions, Knight said she wanted to move away from feeling likethe onus is on her to bat for as long as possible. She wanted freedom.As captain, she has been able to afford that to the rest of her team. All this while questions were beingasked of whether life after Charlotte Edwards would really be so rosy.Those answers will not be able to be given just yet, but Knight was understandably punchy in the press conference.""There was a lot of noise around the squad before the series and the girls have responded. The cricket we have played has been really entertaining to watch. Everyone is feeding off the success of each other and it's been a really nice place to be.""That last point is key. Perhaps one of the most noticeable elements of this England side is how much more open they seem. And while players young and experienced have commented on how Robinson has created a relaxed atmosphere, it has been particularly clearto former players no longer in the system.Caroline Atkins, who represented England between 2001 and 2011, was taken aback at how at ease the players were when she was around the team at Taunton as they prepared for the third ODI. It was not an atmosphere she was used to. Isa Guha and Ebony-Jewel Rainford-Brent have also presented caps to debutants during this tour, something that has rarely happened in English women's cricket. Rainford-Brent, who presented Hartley with her T20 cap before this match, was even invited into the team huddle -a ringed haven usually reserved for squad members.There are of course elements that still need work. On a personnel level, Kate Cross' return to international cricket, after an impressive pre-season tour of Sri Lanka with the England Academy, was disappointing, as she took1 for 56 from the 11 overs she bowled across the first two ODIs. Cross will spend the next few weeks up to theinaugural Women's Super League fine-tuning some technical aspects of her game, such as her front arm, before leading the Lancashire Tunder in what is hoped to be a testingfortnight of high-levelcricket. She will hope her name will be added to the long list of seamers Robinson has healed.Long term, it will be interesting to see whether the confidence gained from these six matches can carry through into something more sustainable. This is not a team that likes to blow their own trumpet. But after six matches of runs, wickets and outright dominance, and given the manner in which they are looking to play their cricket, they might have to get used to it.",07-08-2016,Beaumont and Winfield secure clean ,cricket,CHELMSFORD,Danni;Charlotte;Tash;Katherine;Heather Knight;Atkins;Rainford-Brent;Knight;Nahida Khan;Alex;Heather;Charlotte Edwards;Lauren;Guha;Caroline;Nahida;Beaumont;Isa Guha;Kate;Cross;Winfield;Mark;Khan;Alex Hartley;Isa;Lauren Winfield;Farrant;Brunt;Wyatt;Tammy;Mark Robinson;Robinson;Danni Wyatt;Ebony-Jewel Rainford-Brent;Hartley;Katherine Brunt;Caroline Atkins;Tammy Beaumont;Edwards;Tash Farrant;Kate Cross;Ebony-Jewel,Winfield;Lauren Winfield,England Academy

"HOVE: Sussex's openers, Luke Wells and Harry Finch, added 212 for the first wicket before they declared 72 runs behind, offering Pakistanis the chance to see how keen they are for a proper game on the final day.The ball did not swing conventionally before lunch and the lines were not consistent which enabled Finch and Wells to make a flyer: the fifty up in the eighth over, 120 in 27 by lunch.In the first session it was a case of who bowled least worse but in the hour before tea Wahab Riaz provided a reminder of the danger that can be posed almost out of nowhere when the older ball starts to move.Wells was the first to fall when Wahab, who overstepped 10 times striving for pace, returned for his second spell of the day, his first from the Cromwell Road End, and started to find reverse swing with impressive pace: he will never be a bowler picked for economy, but he has the ability to rattle the batsmen. Wells drove flat-footed at a full delivery, edging behind seven short of a century, then Matt Machan was almost yorked first ball before being beaten by his second delivery.Finch, opening the batting for the first time in first-class cricket, reached his century in Wahab's next over, when he square-drove his 16th boundary, but two balls later was tempted into driving a full delivery and edged to slip.At the Sea End, Imran Khan picked up a brace himself, although they owed a little more to the batsmen's errors. Machan was lbw after a horrid swipe across the line then Ben Brown drove loosely at his first ball: 212 without loss had become 233 for 4 in the blink of an eye.Wells' innings was a continuation of a strong run of form for the tall left-hander who had made 181 last week against Glamorgan. His fifty off 54 balls included 10 boundaries and seven more followed before Wahab found his edge.Finch, whose previous first-class hundred had come against Leeds/Bradford MCCU at the start of this season, gave one chance on 64 when he drove low to short cover off Zulfiqar Babar, but he was particularly impressive on the front foot. His century also included three sixes.Having come in to face a hat-trick ball on first-class debut, Philip Salt played positively after tea before Craig Cachopa was given lbw on the front foot to Zulfiqar to bring the declaration with 24 overs left in the day.For the fourth time on the tour, Mohammad Hafeez reached double figures but not much further when, on 23, he pulled Jofra Archer to deep square leg. As a senior batsman, Pakistan will need Hafeez to lift his game in the Tests to ensure Azhar Ali and Younis Khan are not constantly exposed to the new ball.Shan Masood reached the close unbeaten on 38 but was never entirely convincing.

They failed to win a game in 90 minutes before defeating Wales 2-0 in the semi-finals.However, they now have a glorious chance to follow in the footsteps of that Greek side by beating France in the final and spoling the home party.Coach Fernando Santos knows that France are under pressure to win the trophy on home soil, just as they did at the 1984 Euros and at the 1998 World Cup. But he expects them to cope with that better than Portugal did more than a decade ago.""There is pressure. We have that experience from 2004.

"LONDON: The floppy hair he had as a teenager may have been replaced by a shorter cut and the once clean-shaven face is now home to a goatee beard.But there was no mistaking the whippy left-arm action as Mohammad Amir ran into bowl against Somerset at Taunton last week or the ""airplane"" celebration that greeted his three first-innings wickets.It was a sight many fans would have been forgiven for thinking they would ever see again on an English field after Amirs career came to a dramatic and possibly terminal halt at Lords in 2010.During that years Test against England, Amir and Pakistan new-ball partner Mohammad Asif bowled no-balls to order on the instructions of their captain Salman Butt as part of a sting operation carried out by a tabloid newspaper.All three received five-year bans from cricket and, together with sports agent Mazhar Majeed, jail terms.<br/>There was a sense of shock and anger among cricket fans, although in Amirs case there was also an overwhelming sense of sadness that an 18-year-old should have become caught up in such a scandal.Former West Indies fast bowler Michael Holding is not given to excessive displays of emotion in his work as a television commentator and pundit.Yet he was in tears as he discussed Amirs plight live on air the morning after the night the story broke during the Lords Test.For Amir was -- and on the evidence of the Somerset match still is -- a superbly skilled bowler, with the rare ability to make the ball swing late at sharp pace off a good length, one of the most difficult types of bowling for even the best batsmen to face.It helped him earn him the Pakistan man of the series award against England after he had taken 19 wickets at under 19 apiece in four Tests.Amir, Asif and Butt were all given five-year bans by the International Cricket Council and the trio were all jailed by an English court.Yet the talent Amir had shown created a certain sympathy among cricket fans amid a widespread belief that he had been led astray by more experienced team-mates./><strong>'Second chance</strongNevertheless there were plenty of calls at the time and since for the three players to all be given life bans.<br/>Former England captain Nasser Hussain, speaking soon after the scandal broke, saw both points of view.""Part of me says youve got to make a statement, and say: Right, ban for life....But another part of me says, Should you give a person another chance?.""Amir who served three months in an English young offenders institute, now has that chance.He has only played limited overs internationals for Pakistan since his return, but his career could come full circle when the first of a four-Test series against England starts at Lords on Thursday.Interestingly, Amir himself is now in favour of life bans, telling AFP in an interview in Karachi last month: ""If fixing is still happening then its really alarming. I fully back that fixers should be banned for life.""With Amirs talent undimmed, Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq was in no doubt of his potential.<br/>""If you look at his bowling speed, swing and control -- its there,"" said Misbah ahead of the Somerset match.<br/>""He can still be the best bowler in the world.""England captain Alastair Cook, who played in the 2010 match, suggested Amir might get a rough ride from the Lords crowd.But there were no boos at Taunton and he could well get a polite reception at the ""home of cricket"".<br/>""You dont see many 18-year-olds bowl like he did, he is an exceptional talent,"" said Cook at Lords last week.<br/>""It will be difficult for us.""Meanwhile Amir is well aware of his good fortune. ""I still cant believe that this is happening,"" he said.<br/>""You call it a coincidence or whatever but for me its a blessing that I am restarting (Tests) right at Lords from where I stopped in 2010.""",07-11-2016,Amir s career set to come full cir,cricket,LONDON,Nasser;Cook;Alastair;Mazhar Majeed;Misbah;Misbah-ul-Haq;Nasser Hussain;Michael;Alastair Cook;Mohammad Asif;Majeed;Mohammad Amir;Mazhar;Holding;Hussain;Amir;Butt;Mohammad;Asif;Michael Holding;Salman;Salman Butt,Amir;Mohammad Amir,International Cricket Council;Amirs;AFP;Somerset

"PARIS:Cristiano Ronaldo wept with sadness and joy as substitute Eders extra-time goal saw Portugal beat hosts France 1-0 in Sundays Euro 2016 final to win their first major tournament.Ronaldo was stretchered off in the first half after being injured by Dimitri Payet, but returned to the touchline to see Eders long range strike settle the game at Stade de France.""It was not the final I wanted, but I am very happy,"" Ronaldo said.""It is a trophy for all the Portuguese, for all immigrants, all the people who believed in us, so I am very happy and very proud.""Portugal centre-back Pepe, voted the man of the match, said: ""We said we would win it for him and we managed to do that.""Twelve years after losing 1-0 to Greece as hosts of Euro 2004, Portugal inflicted the same fate on France, who were seeking a cathartic victory eight months on from the Paris attacks that left 130 people dead.France coach Didier Deschamps had hoped to lead his country to a fourth major tournament win, and third on home soil after Euro 1984 and the 1998 World Cup, when he was captain.But it was Portugal skipper Ronaldo who hobbled up the steps to lift the trophy beneath a shower of silver tickertape.""The disappointment is there and its immense,"" Deschamps told French television.<br/>""Weve let a big chance to be champions pass us by. There are no words to describe this feeling.""/><strong>Ugly duckling</strong""Football is cruel, but its also magnificent.

The Bayern Munich winger crossed for Griezmann to head over and released Olivier Giroud for a shot that Rui Patricio parried.Rui Patricio also repelled a 25-yard effort from Sissoko and when France substitute Andre-Pierre Gignac neatly sidestepped the fit-again Pepe in stoppage time, he could only scuff his shot against the post.",07-11-2016,Portugal beat France to win Euro 2016,football,PARIS,Ricardo Quaresma;Patricio;Dimitri;Eder;Figo.Having;Moussa;Didier;Rui Patricio;Antoine;Cristiano;Raphael Guerreiro;Lionel Messi;Eusebio;Rui Patricios;Sissoko;Cruyff;Payet;Silva;Kingsley Coman;Coman;Giroud;Antoine Griezmann;parried.Rui;Dimitri Payet;Fernando Santos;Hugo Lloris;Santos;Griezmann;Laurent Koscielny;Luis;Lloris;Didier Deschamps;Laurent;Adrien Silva;Messi;Guerreiro;Deschamps;Luis Figo.Having;Raphael;Patricios;Adrien;Ronaldo;Quaresma;Koscielny;Cristiano Ronaldo;Lionel;Olivier Giroud;Ricardo;Rui;Griezmanns;Nani;Moussa Sissoko;Andre-Pierre Gignac;Gignac;Pepe;Andre-Pierre;Hugo;Fernando;Kingsley;Olivier;Rui Patricio parried.Rui Patricio,,Bayern Munich;Real Madrid;FIFA

"LONDON: Mohammad Amir may be the centre of attention in the build-up to the first Test against England at Lords, but Thursdays match is also a milestone for Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq.Selection rows and fall-outs with previous Pakistan regimes mean that experienced batsman Misbah is now making his first Test tour of England at the advanced age of 42.It was six years ago that Amir, new-ball partner Mohammad Asif and then-captain Salman Butt tarnished the reputation of Pakistan cricket with their involvement in a spot-fixing affair that saw the trio conspire to deliberately bowl no-balls during the 2010 Lords Test against England.All three were given five-year bans and jail sentences.The intervening period has not been easy for Pakistan, who have had to get used to playing all their ""home"" matches in the United Arab Emirates because of security concerns arising from an armed attack on Sri Lankas team coach in Lahore in 2009.But under Misbahs shrewed guidance Pakistan have become tough to beat in the UAE and a competitive side abroad, traits reflected in their third place in the current world Test rankings -- one position above England.Indeed they have yet to lose a Test series in their adopted home, with England beaten in two of those campaigns for an aggregate 5-0 scoreline in Pakistans favour.An experienced batsman who has had a calming effect on the players around him, Misbah has overseen the reintegration of Amir into the side.Having coped with the understandable interest in Amir making his return to Test cricket at Lords, the scene of the crime, Misbah had no problems in fending off enquiries about how long he intends to keep playing for Pakistan.""My retirement has been discussed every series,"" Misbah told reporters at Lords on Wednesday. ""I could have retired after the UAE against England (last year) -- but weve been playing together for six years.""I decided I need to be here in a tough series for Pakistan, and I really want to do well here.""Misbah has a fine Test record, with nearly 4,500 runs at an impressive average of nearly 49 in 61 matches.Yet for all his experience, there is still something special about playing a Test at ""the home of cricket"".""There are no nerves (yet),"" said Misbah.

"LONDON: Pakistan first Test against England beginning on Thursday (July 14) at Lords will see the long-awaited return of pacer Mohammad Amir to the venue and to the game.Amir was banned in 2010 along with Mohammad Asif and Salman Butt for the infamous spot-fixing scandal. Amir made his domestic comeback playing for Omar Associates in the Grade II Patrons Trophy on March 13, 2015. He took a wicket in his first comeback over.On August 19, 2015, Amir was declared completely free to play all forms of cricket from September 2, 2015.He made his return to international cricket on January 15 this year, in a Twenty20 match against New Zealand. In February 2016, Amir took a hat-trick in a Pakistan Super League match for Karachi Kings.As Amir is all set to make a return to Test cricket on the same venue after a gap of six years, many cricketers believe that the pacer would make a strong impact in the game.Former Twenty skipper Shahid Afridi said the media was putting undue pressure on Amir. He urged Amir to stay strong in the series in England.I am hopeful that Amir will fulfill the expectations of everyone and will perform with all his might in the series against England, he said while talking to a news channel.Test captain Misbah-ul-Haq said if you look at Amirs bowling speed, swing and control it is there. I think he can still be the best bowler in the world, he said.He knows he is under pressure but he is handling that very well. It is a good opportunity for him to come here, where he had those problems, and show the world he can perform and deliver for the team and win back all his fans. Thats what he is working hard for, he said.Former pacer Shoaib Akhtar had advised Amir to remain humble on the England tour and perform with all his might on the field.The best way for Amir to counter is to perform on the field which I am sure he can do. But he also has to remain humble and not show attitude. He has to blend in with his teammates and win matches for them, he said.Pacer Wahab Riaz said as a team, as a squad of 17 plus our team management, all of us are going to support Amir. We are all behind him, we are all supporting him, whenever he needs us, however he needs us, we will be around him all the time, he said.",7/13/2016,Mohammad Amir all set returnTest cri,cricket,LONDON,Wahab Riaz;Misbah-ul-Haq;Mohammad Asif;Mohammad Amir;Shoaib Akhtar;Wahab;Amir;Butt;Mohammad;Shoaib;Asif;Riaz;Salman;Akhtar;Shahid Afridi;Salman Butt;Afridi;Shahid,Mohammad Amir,Omar Associates;Amirs
"LONDON: Former Pakistani cricket team captain and swashbuckling batsman Shahid Afridi said in his latest statement that the cricketing talent in the country did not match up to its demand in Pakistan.>According to details, Afridi expressed his views about cricketing talent in the country during an interview with BBC Urdu.

But it is not producing the sort of talent needed for international cricket. Sorry. No talent,"" he said.Afridi said during the same interview that there was a lot that could be corrected in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) but if he said anything, he would be sent a notice the next morning.Shahid Afridi also spoke on Pakistani fast bowler Mohommad Amir and said that even at such a young age, Amir was quite mature. He said that the bowler was mentally very strong and expressed the hope that Amir would fulfill the expectations that everyone had from him.In response to a question about Mohommad Amir playing for the first time after his spot-fixing scandal, Afridi stated that it was an old practice of the British media to pressurize any cricketer they viewed as a threat before an important series.On the issue of retirement, Afridi said he had never been a burden on the national cricket team. The all-rounder said that God had bestowed him with a lot of respect and that he would continue to play cricket with respect and also quit the game with dignity.In response to a question about improving cricket for women in the country, Afridi stated that it was important first to enhance men's cricket in the country.

"MUMBAI: Cricket pitches need to be more bowler-friendly if the rising imbalance between bat and ball is to be addressed, Indian batting great Sachin Tendulkar has said.The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) world cricket committee on Tuesday recommended limitations on the thickness and depth of bats amid concerns that the sport has tilted heavily in favour of the batsmen in recent years.A report commissioned by the MCC, the guardian of the game's laws, in 2014 found the thickness of bats had marginally increased in the last century and that edges had broadened by 300 percent, meaning even mistimed shots could still find the boundary.Tendulkar, who quit international cricket in 2013 as the game's most prolific batsman both in tests and the 50-over format, demanded more assistance for the bowlers from the playing surface.""The wickets need to change; they need to be more helpful for bowlers,"" Tendulkar said.""In T20s, the greatest of bowlers are being reverse-swept. Three-hundred is no longer competitive in ODIs.""So there should be at least one format where bowlers have a better chance of executing their skills and making it more interesting for spectators.""I don't think it's got much to do with bats, but I'm sure people on the (relevant) panel will be able to look into it.""Tendulkar's views echoed the sentiments of Australian opener David Warner who said last week that flat pitches rather than bats with thicker edges are the reason batsmen have the upper hand in test cricket.Tendulkar was part of the panel that recommended Anil Kumble for the India coach's job and he expects the team to benefit from the vast experience of the former leg-spinner.""A fabulous player, a hard competitor and will not make any compromises on the field,"" Tendulkar told ESPNcricinfo.""He will be out there to win each and every moment.""He played for almost 20 years, so there is plenty to share. I'll just tell the players to grasp as much information from Anil as possible.""Kumble, who came out to bowl with a bandaged jaw in a 2002 Antigua test, can also teach the players how to handle adversity, said Tendulkar.""There are always big, crunch moments in any match and how to approach those moments is important,"" Tendulkar said.""In sport, over a period of time what you learn is not every day you are successful, sometimes you have to face failures.""It is all about being a tough character and be able to stand back on your feet again and to compete the next day.

"LONDON: Yasir Shah became the first leg-spinner in 20 years to take a five-wicket haul in a Test innings at Lords to leave Pakistan well-placed at stumps on Fridays second day of their series opener with England.At the close, England were 253 for seven in reply to Pakistans first innings 339 -- a deficit of 86 runs, with Chris Woakes 31 not out.Shah, in his first Test since serving a three-month drugs ban -- and his first outside of Asia and the United Arab Emirates -- ran through Englands middle-order on the way to five for 64 in 25 overs.It was the first time any leg-spinner had taken five or more wickets in a Test innings at Lords since his compatriot Mushtaq Ahmeds five for 57 in 1996.Earlier, England captain Alastair Cook made 81 and in the process surpassed India great Sunil Gavaskar as the highest run-scoring opening batsman in Test history.But, in sight of a century, he became Mohammad Amirs first Test wicket in six years when the left-arm quick, who twice had Cook dropped, got him to play on.Amir, was making his return to Test cricket at Lords -- the scene of his 2010 spot-fixing crime which saw him given a five-year ban and a jail term for deliberately bowling no balls.Amir should have had Cook out for 22 when an excellent delivery took the outside edge only for first slip Mohammad Hafeez to drop the routine catch.It was a similar story when left-hander Cook, now on 55, again edged Amir but wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed floored the seemingly simple two-handed chance.Amir screamed in frustration before sharing a wry smile with captain Misbah-ul-Haq, who gave the 24-year-old paceman a consoling pat on the back.After the early loss of opener Alex Hales, Cook and new number three Joe Root shared a stand of 110.Cook, belying his reputation as a steady run-maker, struck three fours in four balls as Rahat Ali strayed onto the left-handers pads. But Shah turned the tide when he had Root carelessly hole out off a miscued sweep on 48.James Vince and the recalled Gary Ballance were both lbw as they each failed to pick Shah.Cooks cut four off Amir took him to 61 and beyond Gavaskars mark of 9,607 runs as a Test opener.Amir eventually drew Cook wide and got the left-hander to play on to end a 124-ball innings featuring 12 fours.Jonny Bairstow had rescued England from many a top-order slump in recent times.<br/> But on Friday he was deceived into playing back to Shah and bowled by a top-spinner for 29.That left England 193 for six and they were 232 for seven when, after a prolonged review, Yasir won a tight umpires call decision to have Moeen Ali lbw on the sweep for 23.Even before Alis exit had finally been confirmed, Shah had saluted his fifth wicket Friday by kissing the turf. It was the fifth time in just 13 Tests that the 30-year-old Shah had taken five or more wickets in an innings.Earlier, Woakes took a Test-best six for 70 as Pakistan, 282 for six overnight, were bowled out for 339.Misbah only added four to his overnight 110 not out before he was bowled by Stuart Broad.Amir, booed by a small section of a capacity crowd as he walked out to bat, inside edged his first ball in Test cricket in six years, from Broad, for four and was hit on the helmet next delivery when he ducked into another Broad ball.

"LONDON: Pakistans Mohammad Amir took his first Test wicket in six years when be bowled England captain Alastair Cook at Lords on Friday.Amir was making his return to Test cricket at the scene of his 2010 spot-fixing crime which saw him given a five-year ban and a jail term for deliberately bowling no balls as part of a newspaper sting during that years Lords Test against England.The 24-year-old paceman suffered the frustration Friday of seeing fellow left-hander Cook dropped off his bowling by slip Mohammad Hafeez and wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed, who both missed routine chances, when the opener was on 22 and 55 respectively.But with Cook in sight of a hundred on the second day of the first of a four-Test series, Amir took the fielders out of the equation by inducing Cook to play on for 81.That left England 171 for five in reply to Pakistans first innings 339 -- a deficit of 168 runs.At that stage, Amir had taken one for 46 in 12.2 overs, with his 52nd Test wicket coming in his 15th match at this level.Cook, always a prize wicket for any opposition bowler, had suggested before this match that if it were down to him, all fixers, including Amir, would be banned for life.However, the England skipper added that as Amir had ""served his time"" he had ""no problems"" in playing against him in this four-match series.By dismissing Cook, Amir had taken his first wicket in a Test match since he dismissed Englands Graeme Swann on his way to figures of six for 84 in an innings and 225-run defeat for Pakistan at Lords in 2010 -- a result overshadowed by the spot-fixing scandal.Amir struggled for line and length early in his spell Friday but became increasingly effective as the sunny skies above Lords gave way to swing-friendly grey clouds.Cook, on 22, was drawn forward by an excellent delivery only for first slip Hafeez to drop the straightforward catch.It was a similar story when Cook, now on 55, again edged Amir but Sarfraz Ahmed, going slightly to his left, floored the two-handed chance.<br/> Amir screamed in frustration before sharing a wry smile with Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq, who gave the bowler a consoling pat on the back.The floppy hair Amir sported as a teenage may have given away to a shorter cut and his once clean shaven face may now be home to a goatee beard, but when Cook was out there was no mistaking Amirs trademark arms outstretched airplane celebration.Earlier on Friday, tailender Amir was booed by a small section of a capacity crowd as he walked out to bat.He inside edged his first ball, from Stuart Broad, for four. Next ball he was hit on the helmet as he ducked into a Broad delivery. But Amir also hit two well-struck boundaries before he was last man out for 12, caught in the slips off Broad.",7/15/2016,Amir snares Cook for first wicket of Test retur,cricket,LONDON,Sarfraz Ahmed;Cook;Mohammad Hafeez;Alastair;Graeme Swann;Misbah-ul-Haq;Swann;Graeme;Alastair Cook;Ahmed;Mohammad Amir;Sarfraz;Amir;Mohammad;Hafeez,Cook;Amir;Alastair Cook;Mohammad Amir,
"After being rattled out inside the first hour at Lord's, Pakistan needed to take their chances with the ball in order for their first-innings 339 to assume more daunting proportions. They proceeded to drop Alastair Cook twice, with his unbeaten 75 anchoring the England reply, but three wickets during the afternoon session for Yasir Shah kept Pakistan in the hunt.Chris Woakes' maiden five-wicket haul in Tests had helped finish off Pakistan with only 57 added to their overnight score before the stage was transported back to 2010, as Mohammad Amir prepared to bowl to Cook once again. Amir had previously removed Cook three times in five Tests and he should have added to that tally here but for glaring errors by Mohammad Hafeez, at first slip, and wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed.Cook put on 110 with Joe Root for the second wicket but Yasir struck for his first Test wickets outside of Asia to check England's advance. Root, in his first innings replacing Nick Compton at No. 3, looked at something like his dynamic best before trying slightly too hard to force the pace and top-edging a slog-sweep off Yasir straight up in the air to be taken at midwicket.That gave Pakistan a look at England's reshaped middle-order, with James Vince moving up to No. 4 above the recalled Gary Ballance. Vince briefly shimmered on an otherwise dull, cloudy afternoon, before playing back to be lbw to Yasir - DRS confirming it would have clipped leg stump - for a fifth innings without a significant score at Test level. Ballance clipped one four but was then beaten by a gently turning legbreak, pushing down the wrong line, to leave England 153 for 4 at tea.Amir's first delivery in Test cricket after a five-year ban for his involvement in spot-fixing on this ground was met by a few pseudo-witty cries of ""no-ball"" from the crowd and it was unceremoniously tucked away into the covers for a single by Cook. Amir struggled with his line and length, leaking 33 runs from six overs before lunch, but ought to have removed the England captain when he had made 22, slanting the ball in to take the edge just as he did as a teenager, only for Hafeez to make a mess of a straightforward low catch.Rahat Ali was more accurate with the new ball and he picked up Alex Hales in his first over, angling a delivery across to have him taken at third slip. Cook took advantage of too many deliveries on his pads to pick up seven boundaries - including another edge through the cordon off Amir - and score at more than a run a ball, as he and Root ticked up a fifty stand before lunch.There was further anguish for Amir when he began his second spell during the afternoon, his first delivery luring Cook into a drive as the ball left him, only for the ball to hit Sarfraz on the wrist as he dived to his left.In the morning session, a burst of three wickets in eight balls, including the dismissal of Misbah-ul-Haq for 114, had helped England wrap up Pakistan's innings. Woakes collected two of them to finish with 6 for 70 and join Misbah in having his name added to the honours board. Having been 282 for 4 shortly before the close on Thursday, Pakistan would have been disappointed to make only 339.Misbah, fresh from becoming the oldest captain to score a Test hundred, began the second day with designs on seeing his side up towards 400 and a secure position from which his bowlers could mount an attack. He could only add four runs to his overnight score, however, before Stuart Broad brought a delivery back to burst between bat and pad and rattle the stumps.That dismissal meant Pakistan had gone from 310 for 7 to 316 for 9, with Woakes removing Ahmed and Wahab Riaz in the preceding over. Sarfraz had looked in dangerous mood, frequently stepping down the pitch to cut and drive on his way to 25 from 29 deliveries but he gifted his wicket when slapping a short, wide delivery to backward point to give Woakes his maiden five-for.Two deliveries later, Wahab was following Sarfraz back to the pavilion, as Woakes followed up an excellent outswinger with one of the fastest balls of the match, full and ducking in past a flimsy defence to remove off stump from the ground.As the crowd applauded Woakes' achievements, Amir walked out for his first involvement in a Test since the corresponding Lord's Test in 2010. This was not the main event, of course, but he helped add 23 runs for the final wicket with Yasir Shah in an eventful cameo: his first ball was inside-edged for four over his stumps, the second, also from Broad, went flying off the back of his helmet. There were a couple more genuine boundary strokes before Amir steered Broad to second slip to complete a good morning's work for England.",7/15/2016,Cook dropped twice as England reach 153 4 at ,cricket,,Misbah;Stuart Broad;Gary Ballance;Yasir;Joe;Alex;Root;Compton;Mohammad Amir;Nick;Wahab;Joe Root;Hafeez;Broad;Yasir Shah;Hales;Cook;Mohammad Hafeez;Alastair;Wahab Riaz;Nick Compton;Ballance;Alastair Cook;Sarfraz Ahmed.Cook;Gary;Ahmed;Ahmed.Cook;James;Sarfraz;Amir;Mohammad;Woakes;Vince;Stuart;Riaz;Alex Hales;Shah;James Vince;Ali,Cook;Alastair Cook,Yasir - DRS

"LONDON: Mohammad Amir was denied a wicket on his long-awaited return to Test cricket as England dominated the second morning of the first Test at Lords on Friday.England all-rounder Chris Woakes took a Test-best six for 70 as Pakistan, 282 for six overnight, were bowled out for 339.England then raced to 64 for one at lunch, with captain Alastair Cook -- dropped off Amir -- 35 not out and new number three Joe Root 23 not out.The duos second-wicket stand was so far worth 56 in just 54 balls.But it might all have been different had Cook been out, as he should have been, on 22, with England then 38 for one.The left-hander was drawn forward by an excellent Amir delivery on off stump only for first slip Mohammad Hafeez to drop the routine catch.Pakistan resumed with captain Misbah-ul-Haq 110 not out after the 42-year-old became the oldest player in 82 years to make a Test century on Thursday.But Misbah added just four runs to his overnight score, with Pakistan losing three wickets for six runs in eight balls as the quick and accurate Woakes did the bulk of the damage.Sarfraz Ahmed made a brisk 25 but the wicket-keeper fell tamely when he cut Woakes straight to James Vince at point.That gave the 27-year-old Woakes his maiden five wickets in a Test innings haul in what was the Warwickshire pacemans ninth match at this level.Two balls later Woakes, whose previous best was the three for nine he took against Sri Lanka at Chester-le-Street in May, bowled Wahab Riaz for a duck with an inswinger.Misbah was then late on a Stuart Broad ball that came down the slope and was bowled to end a more than five-hour innings with 18 fours.Amir making his return to Test cricket at Lords -- the scene of his 2010 spot-fixing crime -- walked out to bat to a handful of boos from a capacity crowd.Amir, who served a five-year ban and was given a jail sentence for his part in the spot-fixing row, inside edged his first ball in Test cricket in six years, from Broad, for four.He was then hit on the helmet as he ducked into a Broad delivery.But he also hit two well-struck fours before he was last man out, caught in the slips by Root off Broad, Englands senior bowler in the absence of James Anderson, ruled out with a shoulder injury.Broad took three for 71 in 27.2 overs.Left-armer Amir opened the bowling and his third delivery swung into the middle of Alex Haless bat for a clipped legside four.But Hales fell for six when he misjudged an inswinger from Rahat Ali -- one of three left-arm quicks in Pakistans attack -- and was caught in the slips by Azhar Ali.Cook, belying his reputation as a steady run-maker, struck three fours in four balls as Rahat strayed onto the left-handers pads.Root joined in with five fours, including a classic straight drive off Rahat.",7/15/2016,Mohammad Amir denied England domi,cricket,LONDON,Chris Woakes;James Anderson;Hales;Cook;Mohammad Hafeez;Alastair;Wahab Riaz;Misbah;Misbah-ul-Haq;Alex Haless;Haless;Chris;Rahat;Alastair Cook;Joe;Ahmed;Alex;Azhar Ali.Cook;Root;James;Mohammad Amir;Wahab;Amir;Joe Root;Azhar;Anderson;Mohammad;Hafeez;Woakes;Vince;Riaz;Rahat Ali;Ali.Cook;James Vince;Ali,Mohammad Amir,Stuart Broad;Warwickshire

England all-rounder Chris Woakes, however, twice took two wickets in quick succession at both ends of the day.The Warwickshire paceman bowled nightwatchman Rahat Ali for a duck off what became Thursdays last ball to finish with figures of four for 45 in 18 overs./><strong>Costly Ali</strong> But off-spinner Moeen Ali was expensive, his seven wicketless overs costing 46 runs.<br/>The 42-year-old Misbahs achievement was all the more impressive as this was also his first Test at the home of cricket.Not since Englands Patsy Hendren made a century against Australia aged 45 at Manchesters Old Trafford ground back in 1934 had an older player scored a Test hundred.Remarkably, this was also Misbahs first Test anywhere in England. It looked as if Misbah was about to celebrate his achievement by prostrating himself on the turf in prayer.But instead he performed a series of press-ups in what appeared to be a joke aimed at critics who questioned whether he is now too old for international cricket.The gesture also a wry reference to the pre-tour army-style training camp the squad were put through at the Pakistan Military Academy in the northwestern town of Kakul.""A lot of things have been said about my technique and the outside edge, and the celebration... I promised the guys,"" Misbah told Sky Sports.""We had an Army camp and every time we had to get down and do 10 press-ups. ""Those in my celebration cant count because my arm was bent!""On a more serious note, and turning to the match situation, Misbah said: ""Were in a good position at the moment. We really want to score another 100 runs to give us a good chance.Misbah was dropped on 16 by Joe Root, who grassed a tough slip chance off fast bowler Steven Finn.And he would have been run out for 58 after a mix-up with Shafiq if Gary Ballance had hit the stumps.Misbah was severe on Ali, reverse and conventionally sweeping him for four fours in an over.<br/>Another reverse sweep off Ali took him to 99.A single to third man off Finn saw Misbah to his 10th century in 62 Tests off 154 balls with 17 boundaries.All the pre-match hype had concerned Pakistan paceman Mohammad Amir, making his return to Test cricket at Lords -- the scene of his 2010 spot-fixing crime.But Amir, who served a five-year ban, remained a spectator on Thursday. Pakistans openers got through the new ball ball before first-change Woakes removed them both with a burst of two wickets for five runs in 16 balls.Shan Masood was caught behind by Jonny Bairstow. Woakes and Bairstow combined again to have Mohammad Hafeez (40) caught off a skyer.Pakistan were 76 for two shortly after lunch when Azhar Ali was literally knocked off his feet by a yorker from Jake Ball, given a Test debut after the selectors decided against risking Englands all-time leading wicket-taker James Anderson following a shoulder injury.Ali reviewed and Nottinghamshire quick Ball had an anxious wait before a tight umpires call verdict gave him a first Test wicket.""I really enjoyed my wicket,"" said Ball. ""When he reviewed it, I was nervous because it looked like it was sliding down but to see it clipping leg stump was really nice.""Younis Khan made an elegant 33 before he carelessly chipped Stuart Broad to Ali at square leg.But Shafiq offered excellent support with a 130-ball innings featuring 12 fours. He was out shortly before the close when, trying to withdraw the bat against Woakes with the new ball, he was caught behind.Woakes then made it two for none in 11 balls when he removed Ali to round off an intriguing first day.",7/15/2016,Old Man Misbah leads from front with Lords ,cricket,LONDON,Jonny Bairstow;Ball;Patsy Hendren;Younis Khan;Shafiq;Younis;Misbah;Stuart Broad;Chris;Masood;Gary Ballance;Joe;Bairstow;Root;Mohammad Amir;Joe Root;Moeen Ali;Hafeez;Steven;Broad;Patsy;Moeen;Finn;Chris Woakes;James Anderson;Mohammad Hafeez;Khan;Asad Shafiq;Jake;Misbah-ul-Haq;Ballance;Rahat;Gary;James;Asad;Amir;Azhar;Azhar Ali;Anderson;Mohammad;Woakes;Jonny;Stuart;Finn.And;Steven Finn.And;Rahat Ali;Jake Ball;Ali;Hendren,Misbah,Army;Pakistan Military Academy;Nottinghamshire;Warwickshire
"LONDON: Pakistans Yasir Shah made a useful unbeaten 30 after starring with the ball to leave Pakistan well-placed come stumps on the third day of an intriguing first Test against England at Lords on Saturday.Pakistan were 214 for eight in their second innings at the close, a lead of 281 runs, after leg-spinner Shah took six for 72 in Englands first innings 272.But at stumps he was shaking hands with Chris Woakes after the Warwickshire all-rounder had taken five for 31 to follow the lively pacemans Test-best haul of six for 70 in Pakistans first innings 339.Woakess 11-wicket haul was the first time he had grabbed at least 10 in a Test match.England now need to at least equal their record fourth-inning score to win a Test at Lords of 282 for three against New Zealand in 2004 if they are to go 1-0 up in this four-match series.Sarfraz Ahmed (45) and Shah, promoted from his first innings position of number 11, frustrated England in a seventh-wicket stand of 40.Both batsmen were dropped off the luckless Steven Finn as the fast bowler went wicketless on his home ground.Shah was on two when he chipped Finn out onto the offside and a diving Stuart Broad just failed to cling on to a tough low chance.But Ahmed should have been out for 36 when Finn took the outside only for wicket-keeper Jonny Bairstow, going to his right, to drop the chance as the ball hit his wrist.Fortunately for England, it was not too costly a miss with Woakes producing even simpler chances that Bairstow held to get rid of both the gritty Ahmed and Wahab Riaz (nought).But Finn knew it wasnt his day when Shah, on one knee, hoisted him for four high over deep square leg.Pakistan were 40 for one at lunch after Mohammad Hafeez had carelessly fallen for a duck in cutting Broad straight to Joe Root at second slip.But they lost opener Shan Masood soon afterwards when the left-hander, once more fallible outside off stump, flat-footedly edged Woakes to England captain Alastair Cook at first slip.Azhar Ali (23) then fell lbw to a desperately tight umpires call as Woakes reduced Pakistan to 59 for three.Misbah, in his maiden Test knock at Lords, had made 114 in Pakistans first innings. But on Saturday he fell for nought when he lofted off-spinner Moeen Ali legside and Alex Hales, running round to the mid-wicket rope, held a good catch.Pakistan had never previously lost a Test when Misbah had made a hundred and never won one when he had made a duck but one of those records was now under threat.The unsettled Younis Khan played on to Ali for 25 two balls after driving him for four. Asad Shafiq struck a well-made 49 before,in sight of his second fifty of the match, he was bowled by a Woakes trimmer.Earlier, Shah produced the best innings bowling by a visiting spinner against England in a Test at Lords since Sid Peglers seven for 65 for South Africa back in 1912.Variations in pace and flight saw Shah repeatedly pose problems on an unresponsive pitch.Both sides knew that Shah was likely to be an even greater threat on a wearing fourth-day surface on Sunday.England resumed on their overnight 253 for seven, after Shah induced a middle-order collapse on Friday.They added just 19 more runs Saturday, with Woakes on 35 not out as he emphasised his all-round credentials.",7/16/2016,Yasir stars with bat despite Woakes heroi,cricket,LONDON,Jonny Bairstow;Younis Khan;Shan Masood;Younis;Shafiq;Misbah;Chris;Masood;Yasir;Joe;Alex;Bairstow;Root;Wahab;Sid Peglers;Joe Root;Hafeez;Moeen Ali;Steven;Sid;Yasir Shah;Moeen;Finn;Chris Woakes;Shan;Hales;Peglers;Mohammad Hafeez;Cook;Khan;Alastair;Asad Shafiq;Wahab Riaz;Alastair Cook;Ahmed;Asad;Steven Finn;Mohammad;Woakes;Jonny;Riaz;Alex Hales;Shah;Ali,Yasir;Yasir Shah,Stuart Broad;Warwickshire
"LONDON: Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq followed his first-innings hundred with a duck as England fought back on the third day of the first Test at Lords on Saturday.At tea, Pakistan were 111 for four in their second innings -- a lead of 178 runs.A becalmed Younis Khan, who played several exaggerated leave shots, was 19 not out off 86 balls.But Asad Shafiq had kept the scoreboard ticking over with an unbeaten 29 off 46 balls including five boundaries.Saturdays second session saw England all-rounder Chris Woakes follow his Test-best six for 70 in the first innings with two wickets.Pakistan were 40 for one at lunch after Mohammad Hafeez had carelessly fallen for a duck in cutting Stuart Broad straight to Joe Root at second slip.But they lost opener Shan Masood soon afterwards when the left-hander, once more fallible outside off stump, flat-footedly edged Warwickshire paceman Woakes to England captain Alastair Cook at first slip.Azhar Ali (23) then fell lbw to a desperately tight umpires call as Woakes reduced Pakistan to 59 for three.Misbah, in his maiden Test knock at Lords, had made 114 in Pakistans first innings.But on Saturday he fell for nought when he hoisted off-spinner Moeen Ali legside and Alex Hales, running round to the mid-wicket rope, held a good catch.Pakistan had never previously lost a Test when Misbah had made a hundred and never won one when he had made a duck.With conditions set fair on a sunny day at Lords and more than two days left in the match, something had to give.Younis, on 11, was given out lbw by umpire Joel Wilson after a prolonged and theatrical appeal from fast bowler Steven Finn on his Middlesex home ground. But a review showed the ball missing leg stump and Younis survived.Earlier, leg-spinner Yasir Shah took six wickets as England were bowled out for 272 -- 67 runs behind on first innings.Shahs haul of six for 72 was the best return by a visiting spinner against England at Lords since Sid Peglers seven for 65 for South Africa back in 1912. <br/> Variations in pace and flight saw Shah repeatedly pose problems on an unresponsive pitch.If Pakistans batsmen could give him enough runs to play with in a second innings, Shah was likely to be an even greater threat on a wearing surface.

"LONDON: Yasir Shah took the best innings figures by a visiting spinner against England in a Lords Test innings in more than a century as Pakistan strengthened their grip on the series opener.Pakistan were 40 for one in their second innings at lunch on Saturdays third day of the first Test, a lead of 107 runs.Shan Masood, who spent part of his childhood living near Lords, was 20 not out and Azhar Ali 17 not out.Earlier, Shah took six for 72 as England were bowled out for 272 -- 67 runs behind Pakistans first innings 339.They were the best figures by an overseas spinner against England at Lords since Sid Peglers seven for 65 for South Africa back in 1912.Bounding into the crease, Shahs feat was all the more impressive as his wickets came on a largely unresponsive pitch, with his variations in pace, as much as spin, deceiving the batsmen.England resumed on their overnight 253 for seven, after Shah induced a middle-order collapse on Friday following a second-wicket stand of 110 between skipper Alastair Cook (81) and Joe Root (48).They added just 19 more runs Saturday before they were all out.Wahab Riaz cleaned up Stuart Broad before Steven Finn went the way of several top-order batsmen in falling lbw to Shah.The innings ended when last man Jake Ball was run out by a distance in trying to keep Chris Woakes on strike.Woakes finished on 35 not out to add to his six for 70 in Pakistans first innings.England were then gifted a wicket when Mohammad Hafeez carelessly fell for a duck as he guided Broad straight to Root at second slip in the manner of a coach giving fielders catching practice.But Azhar Ali -- who off-drove debutant Ball for four -- and left-hander Masood, who clipped Broad to the mid-wicket boundary, consolidated Pakistans position.",7/16/2016,Yasir Shah leaves England in a spi,cricket,LONDON,Ball;Finn;Chris Woakes;Peglers;Cook;Mohammad Hafeez;Alastair;Jake;Chris;Masood;Alastair Cook;Yasir;Joe;Root;Sid Peglers;Azhar;Joe Root;Azhar Ali;Steven Finn;Mohammad;Hafeez;Sid;Steven;Woakes;Yasir Shah;Riaz;Shah;Jake Ball;Ali,Yasir Shah,Shahs

But I believe the attention and dedication I had for Messi, is the same thing Messi is doing for Neymar because its very important for a more experienced player to share things with younger players, the 36-year-old Ronaldinho said.And that I believe is one of the reasons that Neymar has adapted to the club and their style of play.Ronaldinho has been without a club since a two-month spell at Brazilian side Fluminense last year and has not ruled out playing in the Indian Super League.I am uncertain but I will go to a place where I feel very comfortable and will consider this possibility (the Indian Super League), the 2005 Ballon dOr winner said.",7/17/2016,Messi still the best despite international failures Ronaldi,football,CHENNAI,Ronaldo;all.Cristiano Ronaldo;Lionel;all.Cristiano;Ballon;Lionel Messi;Messi;Neymar,Ronaldi;Messi;Lionel Messi,Fluminense;Indian Super League;Barcelona;FIFA
"Professional Pakistani boxer Muhammad Waseem Khan on Sunday clinched the World Boxing Council (WBC) Silver Flyweight title in a tough fight against Philippines' Jether Oliva at the Millenium Hilton Hotel in Seoul.President Mamnoon Hussain, Chief Minister Balochistan Sanaullah Zehri, Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif, and other leaders congratulated the boxer over his win. Balochistan Sports Minister Mir Mujeebur Rehman announced a Rs0.5 million prize for Muhammad Waseem after hisvictory.Initially it was an ordinary fight but WBC last month turned it into a world silver title fight. The victory catapults the 28-year-old Pakistani boxer among the top four in the world.Muhammad Waseem, who hails from Quetta, prepared for the fight under famous trainer Jeff Mayweather at the boxing club of renowned boxer Floyd Mayweather Junior in Las Vegas. Jeff is the uncle of Floyd Mayweather Junior, one of the worlds greatest boxers of his time.Waseem comes across as one of the most capable and promising young boxers that Pakistan has produced in recent times.Before this match, Waseem had played only three fights and won them all.The Pakistani boxer, who switched over to pro boxing early last year, made a dream debut when he knocked out.Koreas Min Wook Lee in the ninth round to win the Korean Boxing Commission (KBC) title on October 4, 2015.He knocked out Suparyanto Doglo of Indonesia in the third round in his second bout in Bangkok on December 5, 2015.His last triumph came against Indonesias Bajawa whom he knocked out in Seoul the other month.Waseem is a rare fighter as he began his pro career directly with a ten-round fight. He opted to do so because he had the confidence as he had won several international medals, including an Asian Games bronze, during his amateur career which was hurt by lack of resources and politics within the Pakistan Boxing Federation (PBF).",7/17/2016,Pakistani boxer Waseem wins WBC Silver flyweight ti,boxing,,Sanaullah;Shahbaz Sharif;Bajawa;Sharif;Floyd;Shahbaz;Junior;Hussain;Balochistan Sanaullah Zehri;Jeff Mayweather;Min;Mir;Muhammad Waseem;Oliva;Jether Oliva;Min Wook Lee;Khan;Mayweather;Indonesias Bajawa;Indonesias;Zehri;Suparyanto;Balochistan;Mir Mujeebur Rehman;Floyd Mayweather Junior;Mamnoon;Waseem;Rehman;Lee;Doglo;Mujeebur;Jether;Muhammad;Muhammad Waseem Khan;Jeff;Suparyanto Doglo;Mamnoon Hussain;Wook,Waseem;Muhammad Waseem Khan;Muhammad Waseem,World Boxing Council;Pakistan Boxing Federation;Korean Boxing Commission;WBC;KBC
"LORDS: Pakistan defeated England in the first test match on Sunday after Yasir Shah and Mohammad Amir sent home the bulk of the British batsmen to secure the victory for the country. Yasir Shah was once again the man who did the trick for Pakistan, when a low kept delivery rattled Bairstow's stumps. The latest dismissal meant that Yasir had claimed four wickets this innings while earlier he had claimed six English scalps in the previous innings of England. Mohammad Amir struck for Pakistan right in the next over, when he bowled Stuart Broad.Mohammad Amir finished with two wickets in the end and it was the Pakistani pacer who clean bowled JT Ball to clinch the victory for Pakistan.It was Yasir Shah who had donethe damage earlier tothe English batting side as his two quick wickets after lunch helped put Pakistan in the driving seat. At first, Shah dismissed Ballance before moving on to bowling Moeen Ali out.England were set a target of 283 to win the first Test after bowling out Pakistan for 215 in their second innings on the fourth day.England were 90 for three in their second innings, needing a further 193 runs to reach their victory target of 283, at lunch.

"LONDON: Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan says his countrys stunning victory over England in the Lords Test has restored the teams tarnished reputation.Yasir Shah was Pakistans hero as the leg spinner took 10 wickets in the match to help wrap up a 75-run win in the opening Test on Sunday.It was a cathartic triumph for Pakistan, who were playing their first Test at Lords since the infamous 2010 spot-fixing scandal.That fixture saw Pakistan left-arm quick Mohammad Amir, together with fellow paceman Mohammad Asif and then captain Salman Butt, given five-year bans and jail sentences for conspiring to deliberately bowl no-balls as part of a newspaper sting operation.Fittingly, Amir, in his first Test appearance since he was given the suspension, ended the match when he dismissed Englands Jake Ball and Khan was quick to pay tribute to the efforts of captain Misbah-ul-Haq and his players.""The Lords win is important in many ways and the most significant is that the image of our cricket is restored in more than one way at the venue where it was dented six years ago,"" Khan said.""The team played as a unit and Misbah led it in an exemplary manner while the new team management did a great job.""The best part was the support from Pakistan fans.

"LONDON: Legspinner Yasir Shah, who took a 10-for at Lord's to lead Pakistan to a much awaited victory over England, has climbed up to the top of the ICC rankings for bowlers.Yasir Shah, who became the first Pakistani bowler in 20 years to top the International Cricket Council (ICC) test rankings,is followed by Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin and the England pace duo James Anderson and Stuart Broad.Mushtaq Ahmed was the last bowler from Pakistan to top the rankings since in December 1996.Yasir has 86 wickets from 13 Tests and is within touching distance of breaking a 120-year old record - the fastest to 100 Test wickets. George Lohmann, the England fast bowler, had reached the mark in 16 Tests in 1896.Yasir had been ranked No. 4 before the start of the series, but a compelling display on a day two pitch offering no turn and remarkable exploitation of a wearing pitch and worried batsmen on day four pushed him up three places.His 6 for 72 in the first innings and 4 for 69 in the second made him the first legspinner ever to claim a 10-for at Lord's. Among his wickets was a vicious legbreak that pitched a considerable distance outside Gary Ballance's off stump, turned square and knocked the leg stump back, invoking memories of Shane Warner toppling Andrew Strauss in Edgbaston in the 2005 Ashes.",7/18/2016,Yasir Shah crowned worlds no1 Test bowler,cricket,LONDON,Shane;Andrew Strauss;James Anderson;Lohmann;Shane Warner;Warner;George;Ravichandran;Gary Ballance;Ballance;Stuart Broad.Mushtaq Ahmed;Yasir;Gary;Ahmed;James;Broad.Mushtaq;Andrew;George Lohmann;Ravichandran Ashwin;Anderson;Strauss;Stuart;Yasir Shah;Ashwin;Shah,Yasir Shah,Lord's;International Cricket Council;ICC
"LONDON: Mohammad Amir returned to the hallowed ground of Lord's he defiled six years ago to earn Pakistan one of their most memorable test triumphs over England on Sunday.The fast bowler, who served a five-year ban and jail time after admitting spot-fixing at the home of cricket in 2010, took the final wicket of the first test to give Pakistan a well-deserved 75-run victory.While Amir's return to the game divides opinion, it felt like partial redemption for the 24-year-old who was cleared to return to the sport last September and who was making his first test appearance since his ban ended.Amir removed the key wicket of captain Alastair Cook in the first innings, and then finished off England's resistance on Sunday as he destroyed Jake Ball's stumps to spark joyous scenes from the Pakistan fans.""He's part of the team that has won the test match, it will be one of the memorable days of his life and from here he can start his career again,"" Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq said.""He's a good kid now, he's a mature cricketer and he can prove to everyone that he's a good bowler.""Amir was touted as a potential great when he burst onto the international stage as a teenager, making his test debut at 17.But his world fell apart when he admitted to deliberately bowling no-balls against England and was convicted along with Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif who received seven and 10 year bans respectively.The conspiracy rocked world cricket and reputation of Pakistan cricket was tarnished, but Misbah said the victory at Lord's on Sunday completed a long journey back from the depths for a nation mad about the sport.""It's been a remarkable turnaround after the 2010 incident,"" Misbah said.""The team took real responsibility and these players showed a lot of respect for the game, fought throughout the six years and brought plenty of wins.

"Rio de Janeiro: The Saudi Olympic Committee has approved four female Saudi athletes to compete as part of the conservative Gulf kingdom's team at the Rio Olympics, a spokesman said on Sunday.Sara Al-Attar, Lubna Al-Omair, Cariman Abu Al-Jadail and Wujud Fahmi will become only the second group of women Olympians to represent Saudi Arabia, where women are barred from driving and are subject to a restrictive male guardianship system.But the historic decision was complicated by the kingdom's thorny gender politics, as the official announcement of the Olympic team named only the seven men who will compete.The announcements of the names of the male and female team members were made separately given the sensitivities regarding gender segregation and women's athletics in Saudi Arabia, said Saudi Olympic Committee Chief Executive Hosam Alqurashi.The four women will be given wildcard entries so they can compete without meeting formal qualification standards, a spokesman said.Saudia Arabia entered two women under a similar arrangement for the 2012 Olympics in London in what was a symbolic first for the oil-rich Islamic nation.Attar is a veteran of the London games, where she ran in the 800 metres. She will be joined in Rio by another runner, Abu Al-Jadail, who will run in the 100 metres. Omair will participate in fencing, while Fahmi will be in the under-52 kg judo event.Women in Saudi Arabia face significant hurdles to practice sport. They must wear head-to-toe garments in public, observe strict rules on gender segregation and obtain permission from a male guardian to travel, study or marry.Women's gyms are not currently eligible for licences, making them scarce in the kingdom.

"TORONTO: With the Rio Olympics less than three weeks away, the IOC on Monday promised ""the toughest sanctions available"" after a report found Moscow had concealed hundreds of positive doping tests in many sports ahead of the Sochi winter Games.The International Olympic Committee (IOC) did not spell out whether it would heed growing calls for Olympic bans already imposed on Russia's track and field athletes and weightlifters to be extended to all its competitors in Rio.However, IOC President Thomas Bach said the independent World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) investigation had revealed ""a shocking and unprecedented attack on the integrity of sport and on the Olympic Games.The IOC Executive Board is to hold a telephone conference on Tuesday to take its first decisions, which may include provisional measures and sanctions with regard to the Rio Olympics.""Therefore, the IOC will not hesitate to take the toughest sanctions available against any individual or organisation implicated.""WADA itself explicitly urged the IOC to consider banning Russia from the Rio Olympics altogether.Russian President Vladimir Putin, who staked his reputation on the Sochi Games, the costliest in history, said the WADA-backed report was the result of political interference and that the Olympic movement could now split.The report confirmed allegations made by Grigory Rodchenkov, former head of the Moscow Anti-Doping Laboratory.He told the New York Times two months ago that dozens of Russians had used performance-enhancing drugs in Sochi with the support not only of national sports authorities but even the domestic intelligence service, the FSB.Monday's report said Russia, a traditional sporting superpower, had been stung into action by its performance at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics, where it finished 11th, with only three gold medals.""The surprise result of the Sochi investigation was the revelation of the extent of State oversight and directed control of the Moscow Laboratory in processing and covering up urine samples of Russian athletes from virtually all sports before and after the Sochi Games,"" said the report, unveiled in Toronto.strong>""FAILSAFE STRATEGY""</strongThe investigation was led by Canadian sports lawyer Richard McLaren, who sat on the independent commission that last year exposed doping and corruption in Russian track and field, leading to its exclusion from international competition.The report said Deputy Sports Minister Yuri Nagornykh had been advised of every positive test across all sports from 2011 onwards and decided ""who would benefit from a cover up and who would not be protected.""The State implemented a simple failsafe strategy,"" it said. ""If all the operational precautions to promote and permit doping by Russian athletes proved to have been ineffective for whatever reason, the laboratory provided a failsafe mechanism.""The State had the ability to transform a positive analytical result into a negative one by ordering that the analytical process of the Moscow Laboratory be altered.""Among the hundreds of samples that disappeared were 35 from Paralympic athletes.In Sochi itself, where international observers were scrutinizing the drug tests, positive results could not simply be brushed away, so the FSB developed a method of opening urine bottles to allow samples to be swapped undetected.Rodchenkov spoke of a clandestine night-time operation in which staff secretly took samples from the lab via a ""mouse hole"" cut into a wall, and replaced them with clean samples taken from the same athlete months earlier and sometimes manipulated.strong>""CREDIBLE WITNESSES""</strongMcLaren said Rodchenkov and all other witnesses interviewed had been deemed credible, and the report said the investigators ""confirm the general veracity of the published information concerning the sample swapping that went on at the Sochi Laboratory during the Sochi Games"".The investigations showed that caps had been removed from a number of samples, and that they contained unusually high levels of salt, ""significantly exceeding the levels produced by the human body"".Nagornykh and Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko, who was mentioned 21 times in McLaren's 97-page report, were not immediately available for comment.Putin said in a statement that there was ""no place for doping in sport"", and that the officials named in the report would be suspended.Following the statement, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev suspended Deputy Sports Minister Nagornykh.Putin also said the allegations were based on the testimony of only one man, and were an attempt to ""make sport an instrument of geopolitical pressure, to form a negative image of countries and peoples"".Harking back to the tit-for-tat superpower boycotts of the 1980s, he said: ""The Olympic movement ... may again be on the verge of a split.""In a leaked draft letter intended to be sent to the IOC on Monday, U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) CEO Travis Tygart called for a ban on all Russian athletes, not only in track and field.Paul Melia, head of the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sports, said the letter was backed by various athletes' committees and the anti-doping organisations of the United States, Germany, Japan and New Zealand, among others.However, Russian track and field athletes have appealed against their ban to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which is due to rule by Thursday.If it finds in their favour, there would seem to be little chance of a wider ban on Russian competitors holding up.Bach had indicated last week that he was reluctant to see athletes from one sport punished for the crimes of athletes or officials from another.",7/19/2016,IOC vows toughest sanctions after report finds Moscow ran broad doping ,olympics,TORONTO,Nagornykh.Putin;Travis Tygart;Thomas Bach;Putin;Dmitry Medvedev;Nagornykh;Yuri Nagornykh;Rodchenkov;Richard;Yuri;Bach;Thomas;Dmitry;Grigory Rodchenkov;Mutko;Vitaly Mutko;Vladimir Putin;Tygart;Vitaly;Grigory;Travis;Vladimir;Richard McLaren;Medvedev;McLaren,,The State;New York Times;World Anti-Doping Agency;Court of Arbitration for Sport;Games.The International Olympic Committee;U.S. Anti-Doping Agency;Moscow Anti-Doping Laboratory.He;WADA;IOC Executive Board;FSB;USADA;Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sports;IOC;McLaren
"LONDON: England are seeking more regular help for their spinners after recruiting former Pakistan bowler Saqlain Mushtaq for the Old Trafford Test which starts on Friday.Saqlain linked up with England for practice in Manchester today and will work with spinners Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid, as well as advising batsmen how to play Pakistan leg-spinner Yasir Shah.England have not had a permanent spin coach since Mushtaq Ahmed returned to Pakistan at the start of 2014 and they are keen to address the situation. It is thought a coach will join the squad for the winter tours of India and Bangladesh, where spin will be prominent.Saqlain is one of the contenders for the role while Daniel Vettori, the former New Zealand left-arm spinner, recently spent time with the England Performance Programme at a training camp in Dubai. Robert Croft, who played 21 Tests, was recruited for a part of last winters tour of South Africa.Mushtaq Ahmed worked closely with Graeme Swann during his time with England, helping Swann become one of the worlds best spinners. England know Moeen needs mentoring, especially as he has struggled to make an impression with the ball since England regained the Ashes last summer.Rashid has played only three Tests, against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates last autumn, but is back in the squad for Old Trafford as England look to square the Investec Series, which Pakistan lead 1-0. Former England pace bowler Andrew Caddick will spend a day with the team before the Third Test at Edgbaston, which starts on August 3.Caddick has been invited for the training session on August 1, in which he will observe the session and work alongside Englands fast bowlers.Caddick took 234 wickets in 62 Tests and was part of an effective new-ball combination with Darren Gough under the captaincy of Nasser Hussain.

"MANCHESTER: England all-rounder Ben Stokes hailed Pakistans Yasir Shah on Wednesday as the best leg-spinner since Australia great Shane Warne.Shah bowled Pakistan to a 75-run win over England in the first Test at Lords last week with a brilliant match-haul of 10 for 141.His return left Shah atop the International Cricket Council (ICC) Test bowler rankings and was all the more impressive as the pitch at Lords did not offer excessive turn.That left Shah with 86 wickets in a mere 13 Tests at an average of 23, compared to Warnes mammoth 708 in 145 Tests at just over 25 apiece in a career that ended in 2007.Conditions could favour Shah far more at Old Trafford, where the second Test starts on Friday.Stokes, who will hope to make his return to Test cricket at the Manchester ground after a knee injury, was in no doubt of Shahs quality.""Yasir Shah, I reckon, is the best leg-spinner since Shane Warne,"" Stokes told an Old Trafford press conference broadcast on Sky Sports.""They are a very good team but we go into the Test match knowing how he goes about bowling and we should be able to counteract that,"" the Durham all-rounder added.""(The conditions are) another thing we will have to try and adapt to and well just see how it goes.""Stokes has not played for England since injuring his knee in the first Test against Sri Lanka in May.He returned to action as a batsman only with Durham before, after being deemed not fully fit for the Pakistan opener, bowling for his county against Lancashire last week.Having not shown any adverse effects following his bowling stint, the 25-year-old Stokes is eager to resume his England career.""Its the first game where I have played doing both parts of my game,"" he explained.""I have been playing as a batsman for two weeks, it is something I definitely did need, to get myself back into match situations.""I have been bowling in the nets but you cant replicate doing that, the only thing you can do is bowl in a game.

"ANTIGUA: Indias test ranking has long been based on their formidable home form but the side aim to impress new coach Anil Kumble by showing they can adapt to conditions outside the subcontinent in a four-test against West Indies starting in Antigua on Thursday.For the hosts, however, the task is more straightforward -- simply proving they can still be competitive in the long form of the game.Since last touring West Indies in 2011, when they ground out a 1-0 test series victory (with two draws), India have lost six consecutive series outside of Asia - two each in England and Australia and one each in South Africa and New Zealand.Their record in that time is one win, 15 defeats and five draws.That does not include a 2-1 series victory in nearby Sri Lanka last year, where conditions are typically similar to those encountered at home.Former leg-spinner Kumble was recently appointed head coach of the Indians, who are second behind Australia in the test rankings, after pitching a plan to fix that miserable away record.And while he has already moved to tighten discipline, introducing a fine of $50 for being late, he shies away from being branded a strict disciplinarian.""All I know I am a cricket coach and whether I am strict or lenient, you will probably have to ask the team,"" he said recently.Kumble could hardly ask for a better chance to start the job on a winning note than against a West Indies team weakened by administrative conflict and the unavailability of several key players, with fast bowler Jerome Taylor the latest to retire from the test format.While West Indies excel in the Twenty20 format, they are eighth of nine nations in the test rankings, ahead only of minnows Bangladesh.Kumble has stressed his team must demonstrate patience throughout the series, a sentiment shared by West Indies all-rounder Carlos Brathwaite.""We expect to face a lot of spin against the Indians in this series, so it is about playing the waiting game,"" said Brathwaite, who blasted four sixes in a row against England to seal West Indies World Twenty20 triumph in April.""We need to look to spend long periods at the crease so we are preaching that in the dressing room.""After the first test in Antigua, the remaining tests will be played in Jamaica (July 30- Aug. 3), St Lucia (Aug. 9-13) and Trinidad (Aug. 18-22).strong>SQUADS:</strongstrong>West Indies:</strong> Jason Holder (captain), Kraigg Brathwaite, Devendra Bishoo, Jermaine Blackwood, Carlos Brathwaite, Darren Bravo, Rajendra Chandrika, Roston Chase, Miguel Cummins, Shane Dowrich, Shannon Gabriel, Leon Johnson, Marlon SamuelsIndia.strong>India:</strong> Virat Kohli (captain), Ajinkya Rahane, Ravichandran Ashwin, Stuart Binny, Shikhar Dhawan, Ravindra Jadeja, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Amit Mishra, Mohammed Shami, Cheteshwar Pujara, Lokesh Rahul, Wriddhiman Saha, Rohit Sharma, Shardul Thakur, Murali Vijay, Umesh Yadav, Ishant Sharma.",7/20/2016,India Windies contrasting challenges test seri,cricket,ANTIGUA,Umesh Yadav;Shannon Gabriel;Ravindra Jadeja;SamuelsIndia.strong;Ravindra;Ravichandran;Ishant Sharma;Jermaine;Leon;Bhuvneshwar;Miguel Cummins;Binny;Umesh;Cheteshwar;Rajendra;Chase;Anil;Gabriel;Bishoo;Rahane;Wriddhiman Saha;Amit Mishra;Dowrich;Anil Kumble;Kraigg;Jermaine Blackwood;Mishra;Yadav;Johnson;Mohammed Shami;Amit;Mohammed;Pujara;Bhuvneshwar Kumar;Dhawan;Jerome;Carlos Brathwaite;Shardul;Shane Dowrich;Cheteshwar Pujara;Shane;Vijay;Jadeja;Miguel;Shannon;Devendra Bishoo;Murali Vijay;Darren;Rohit Sharma;Lokesh Rahul;Ajinkya;Jason;Virat;Rohit;Taylor;Lokesh;Ajinkya Rahane;Virat Kohli;Kohli;Devendra;Ashwin;Marlon;Bravo;Jerome Taylor;Marlon SamuelsIndia.strong;Murali;Saha;Kumar;Shardul Thakur;Kumble;Rajendra Chandrika;Brathwaite;Roston Chase;Shikhar Dhawan;Leon Johnson;Stuart Binny;Ishant;Rahul;Roston;Wriddhiman;Thakur;Holder;Kraigg Brathwaite;Blackwood;Cummins;Shami;Darren Bravo;Ravichandran Ashwin;Jason Holder;Sharma;Chandrika;Stuart;Shikhar;Carlos,,West Indies World;Bangladesh.Kumble

""I look forward to coming back to Canada next year.""Nadal, who has been out of action since pulling out of the French Open following his second-round match with a wrist injury, said he was not fit enough to return to competition.The 30-year-old Spaniard, a three-times winner of the Rogers Cup tournament that alternates each year between Toronto and Montreal, was only recently given clearance to compete in Rio despite not fulfilling the qualification criteria.""I only started practicing a week ago after my wrist injury and I am not ready to play such an important event,"" said Nadal.The Rogers Cup, where world number one Novak Djokovic is top seed, will run from July 23-31 and the tennis competition at the Rio Olympics will be held Aug. 6-14.",7/20/2016,Federer Nadal pull out of Toronto ev,tennis,TORONTO,Roger;Novak;Federer;Andy Murray;Nadal;Djokovic;Murray;Rafa;Roger Federer;Novak Djokovic;Rafa Nadal;Andy,Federer Nadal,Nadal.The Rogers Cup
"LONDON: Coach Trevor Bayliss hinted England might field two spinners in the second test against Pakistan as the hosts chase a series-levelling victory at old Trafford.Leg-spinner Adil Rashid, along with fit-again all-rounder Ben Stokes and pacer James Anderson, was called into England's 14-man squad following their 75-run defeat in the first test at Lord's.""I've always thought of playing two spinners (at home), at some stage. Pakistan have three left-arm pace bowlers, who created rough outside the off stump for (off-spinner) Moeen (Ali),"" Bayliss told British media.""So looking ahead, if we did happen to have two spinners, they could both play an important part for us.""The hosts struggled against Yasir Shah's leg-spin at Lord's and will need to do better when the second test begins on Friday.For them, James Vince scored 42 in the second innings but could not convert it into something big.Vince averages 18-plus after four tests but Bayliss seemed to have faith in the 25-year-old.""I think it would be an injustice if he does not make it, but in the end it will be the number of runs that determine his longevity in the team,"" Bayliss said.""If you ask anyone who has been in that situation they will say it is difficult to go out and play your natural game.

"So Paulo: Brazil's intelligence agency said on Tuesday it was investigating all threats to next month's Rio Olympics after a presumed Brazilian Islamist group pledged allegiance to Islamic State (IS) less than three weeks before the Games.The SITE Intelligence Group that monitors the internet reported that a group calling itself ""Ansar al-Khilafah Brazil"" said on the Telegram messaging app on Sunday that it followed IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and had promoted IS propaganda in Arabic, English and Portuguese.Brazilian authorities stepped up security measures following the truck massacre in Nice last week, planning security cordons, further roadblocks and the frisking of visitors in Rio de Janeiro for the Olympics.Police and soldiers took part over the weekend in drills near sports facilities and along transport routes.The Games start on Aug. 5 and are expected to attract as many as 500,000 foreign visitors.""All threats related to the Rio 2016 Games are being meticulously investigated, particularly those related to terrorism,"" the Brazilian intelligence agency ABIN said in a statement when asked to comment on the previously unknown group's claim of support for Islamic State.""Many are dismissed and those that deserve attention are investigated exhaustively,"" ABIN said. An agency spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the posting by the group presented a credible threat.ABIN last month confirmed it had detected a Portuguese account on the Telegram app that was a channel for exchanging information on Islamic State but authorities said no threat had been detected of an attack in Brazil.Since Thursday's attack in Nice where a truck ploughed through crowds during Bastille Day celebrations, Brazil has sought to reassure the international community that the Games will be safe and terrorist threats are being taken seriously.On Monday, interim President Michel Temer issued a video message inviting foreigners to come to Rio and enjoy the Games and the beauty of the host city.""We have reinforced security very much in the city and you can come without worries. You can enjoy the marvels of Rio de Janeiro and attend the Games,"" he said in the brief video.Brazilian security officials say they are in close contact with partner countries about any possible threats to the Games and have been monitoring chatrooms and other communications among suspected sympathizers of radical groups.They said their biggest concern during the Olympics is not the threat of a coordinated attack by known militants but the possibility that a lone actor or group sympathetic to militant causes could seek to target the event.Brazil will deploy about 85,000 soldiers, police and other security personnel, more than twice the size of the security deployment during the London Olympics in 2012.",7/20/2016,Brazil probes Olympics threats after group backs Islamic S,olympics,Sao Paulo,Ansar;Michel Temer;Michel;al-Baghdadi;Abu;Temer;Bakr;Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,,Nice;ABIN;Islamic State;Games.The SITE Intelligence Group

"SAN FRANCISCO: Top seed Venus Williams fended off a spirited challenge in her opening match against world No. 87 Magda Linette at the WTA Tours Stanford tournament Wednesday as she needed three sets to advance.Former two-time champion Williams defeated Linette 6-3, 6-7 (6/8), 6-2 to reach the quarter-finals of the hardcourt tournament at Stanford University.The 36-year-old Williams is hoping she doesnt suffer a post-Wimbledon letdown and she now has an easy path to the semi-finals since her next opponent wont be ranked in the top 200 in the world.Williams will face either Catherine Bellis, who is ranked 203rd, or Sachia Vickery who is one spot back of Bellis in the world rankings.""It would be very special to get No. 50 here but I am just going to try to keep advancing,"" said Williams who has 49 career titles after winning in Kaohsiung, Taiwan earlier this year.Williams blasted 11 aces and had four double faults against Linette in the two hour, 14 minute match on the main stadium.Earlier this month Williams reached the semi-finals of Wimbledon, her first semi at a major in five years.Williams played her first professional tennis match at this event in 1994 and she has won here twice but not since beating Kim Clijsters 14 years ago.The former world number one has seen her game fall on hard times over the past several years.And she got off to a rocky start to this season before recovering, losing in the first round of the Australian Open to the 47th ranked Johanna Konta. To add insult to injury, organizers fined her a record $5,000 for refusing to attend the post match news conference. She also suffered losses in opening second round matches at both Miami and Indian Wells.Linette, who is ranked second in Poland behind Agnieszka Radwanska, had to be pleased to take the world number seven to three sets in her Stanford debut.In 2015 she made her Grand Slam debuts at the French Open, US Open and Wimbledon.strong>- No mercy for partner -</strongIn other matches, fifth seeded Misaki Doi showed no mercy against her Japanese doubles partner Nao Hibino, winning in straight sets 6-3, 6-4 in their second round match.Doi, who is ranked 36th in the world, advances to the next round where she will face either second seed Dominika Cibulkova or Urszula Radwanska of Poland.Doi is hoping that a good run through the rest of the summer will help her earn a seeding spot for the upcoming US Open.Doi defeated Karolina Pliskova in Wimbledons second round, forced Sam Stosur to play three sets in a first round loss at the French Open, and gave Angelique Kerber a scare at the Australian Open earlier this year, taking the eventual champion to match point in the early rounds.British No. 1 Konta took care of business, beating Julia Boserup 6-3, 6-1 in just over an hour.Her Stanford debut continues in the quarter-finals where she will face Chinas Zheng Saisai, who upset seventh seeded Frenchwoman Alize Cornet 6-4, 6-1.",7/21/2016,Venus Williams pulls out three set win Stanford,tennis,SAN FRANCISCO,Konta;Nao Hibino;Misaki;Sachia;Urszula Radwanska;Radwanska;Linette;Kerber;Magda;Sachia Vickery;Kim Clijsters;Johanna;Sam Stosur;Misaki Doi;Doi;Chinas;Karolina;Catherine;Kim;Dominika Cibulkova;Angelique Kerber;Venus;Chinas Zheng Saisai;Vickery;Hibino;Stosur;Agnieszka Radwanska;Sam;Urszula;Johanna Konta;Dominika;Julia Boserup;Cornet;Williams;Catherine Bellis;Karolina Pliskova;Agnieszka;Angelique;Alize Cornet;Magda Linette;Pliskova;Boserup;Saisai;Bellis;Venus Williams;Alize;Cibulkova;Julia;Zheng;Clijsters;Nao,Venus Williams,Stanford;WTA Tours Stanford
"NORTH SOUND, Antigua: Virat Kohli continued his efficient and energetic accumulation of runs to bring up his maiden first-class double hundred, but his dismissal in the first over after lunch brought West Indies some relief as 108 came off 35 overs in the second session.Promoted to No. 6, R Ashwin enjoyed some luck in the first hour of the day before strolling to his third hundred against West Indies, taking his average against them to 76.2.Kohli's intent - helped no doubt by a flat pitch and tiring bowlers - foiled West Indies' plan pretty much from ball one: bowl defensively and ensure your stacked-up batting line-up has less time to survive. Kohli himself batted at 4.2 an over.Apart from Shannon Gabriel, no bowler - there was only one more specialist in the side - actively looked out for wickets, relying on frustrating batsmen. However, captain Kohli, India's first to score an away double, took risks and made the bowlers bowl to him because he was driving the wide ones too.Gabriel, though, should have had a wicket added to his one from day one early on the second day. Shane Dowrich had waited for 423 overs over three Tests for his first opportunity for a dismissal, but Gabriel produced the outside edge from Ashwin for a sitter, his eagerness to celebrate led to the sitter's being grassed. West Indies still managed to keep Ashwin quiet - at one point he went 40 balls for four runs - but Kohli kept finding a way around the defensive lines.Cover driving, as usual, remained the feature of Kohli's innings. When he gave the treatment to Devendra Bishoo in the 105th over, the boundary took him past his previous best of 169; it was his 50th run through the covers. A sign of how well he batted came in how, in the 113th over, he played perhaps the only ungainly shot of his innings, a half-sweep across the line to deep midwicket. Turned out he had picked the rare wrong'un from Bishoo, and was actually playing with the spin.Slow pitch, fielders in front, no pace to work with, and West Indies finally had a quiet session. Ashwin didn't look in any hurry, Wriddhiman Saha tried to break the monotony, succeeding on a couple of occasions before getting stumped to finally give Dowrich a maiden Test dismissal. Overall, though, West Indies refused to attack, which could also give India scoring opportunities, and India didn't seem overly bothered with the slow going.Seven minutes before tea, with a back-foot punch through midwicket, Ashwin brought up his hundred, reminding you of the shot of the day, a back-foot punch through mid-on for four. Amit Mishra's enterprise at the other end - 23 off 39 - brought India some quick runs.

"MANCHESTER: Joe Roots unbeaten 141 was the centrepiece of Englands commanding 314 for four on the first day of the second Test against Pakistan at Old Trafford on Friday.England captain Alastair Cook, who won the toss on a good pitch and in sunny conditions ideal for batting, made 105 and shared a second-wicket stand of 185 with Root.Having twice got himself out during Englands 75-run defeat by Pakistan in the first of a four-Test series at Lords last week, a determined Root did not give a chance in just over six hours at the crease on Friday.Pakistans left-arm pace trio of Mohammad Amir, Rahat Ali and Wahab Riaz became increasingly threatening as the skies clouded over late on.<br/> Amir took two for 63 and Rahat two for 69, with both men bowling 20 overs on Friday.But star leg-spinner Yasir Shah, who took a man-of-the-match winning 10 wickets at Lords, returned figures of none for 111 in 31 overs.Amir had opener Alex Hales dropped in the gully on six by Asad Shafiq.<br/> But three balls later, having repeatedly moved the ball away from Hales, Amir skilfully swung the ball back into the right-handed opener and knocked over his middle and off stumps.England were now 25 for one after seven overs.At lunch, England were 95 for one with Cook 40 not out and Root 41 not out.<br/> <br/> Root just beat Cook to the fifty milestone, getting there in 86 balls to the captains 90. Cook reached the landmark in style with a straight-driven four -- a clear sign he is in top form -- off Shah.A similar stroke saw him into the 90s and raised the 150 stand. <br/> Cooks two to mid-wicket off Amir saw him to a hundred in 157 balls including 14 fours and the normally restrained Essex batsman celebrated his century with several fist pumps.Left-handed opener Cooks 29th Test century meant he extended his own England record and drew the Essex batsman level with Australia great Don Bradmans tally.<br/> Bradman, however, played just 52 Tests while this was Cooks 131st match in the format.More signficantly, this was Cooks first century in 20 Test innings since his monumental 263 against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi in October.But Amir then took the shine off an excellent session for England by bowling Cook following an under-edge from a ball that kept low.That became the last delivery before tea, with England 210 for two at the interval.James Vince, looking for a maiden Test fifty to cement his place in the side, fell in all too familiar fashion when, on 18, he chased a wide Rahat delivery outside off stump, with his edged drive caught low down by wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed.What made his dismissal all the worse wast that Vince had been dropped by Younis Khan in the slips off a similar shot when on six off Amir.Root, 87 not out at tea, went to his 10th hundred in 44 Tests with his 14th four in 167 balls when he drove Shah wide of mid-on in textbook fashion.Gary Ballance (23) then helped Yorkshire team-mate Root add on 73 before he chopped on against Rahat.England have not lost a home Test batting first since 2012, a sequence encompassing 10 wins and two draws.",7/22/2016,Cook Root tons help England reach 314 4 against Paki,cricket,MANCHESTER,Younis Khan;Roots;Shafiq;Younis;Don Bradmans;Bradman;Yasir;Joe;Alex;Don;Bradmans;Joe Roots;Mohammad Amir;Wahab;Yasir Shah;Hales;Cook;Khan;Alastair;Asad Shafiq;Wahab Riaz;Ballance;Rahat;Alastair Cook;Sarfraz;Amir;Asad;Mohammad;Vince;Ahmed.What;Sarfraz Ahmed.What;Riaz;Rahat Ali;Alex Hales;Shah;Ali,Cook;Alastair Cook,Yorkshire;Essex
"NORTH SOUND, Antigua: Virat Kohli continued his efficient and energetic accumulation of runs to bring up his maiden first-class double hundred, which took India past 400 in the first session of the second day.This was the first away double-century by an India captain. In a wicketless session that went for 102 runs, R Ashwin enjoyed some luck but also displayed some attractive shots; a back-foot punch for four through mid-on was the shot of the session. The partnership between the two swelled to 168.As was the case on day one, Gabriel bowled a short burst with the new ball, which was taken first thing in the morning. He tested Ashwin, who was dropped on 43 by Dowrich, who looked like he was already thinking of celebrating even before completing the simple catch. Jason Holder looked unremarkable at the other end; Carlos Brathwaite did a better job of testing the batsmen's patience with consistent bowling a set of stumps outside off stump.The tactic had kept India's top order quiet in the first session of the match, but Kohli didn't wait for too long before taking a calculated risk, which was executed so well it didn't look like a risk. Kohli has his own way of choosing what balls to drive. Each delivery of Brathwaite's first three overs was bowled to Kohli, who attempted to score off only one, the widest of the lot. It wasn't a half-volley either, but Kohli drove superbly on the up, and got a boundary to break any pressure the joining of dots creates.Cover driving, as usual, remained the feature of Kohli's innings. When he gave the treatment to Devendra Bishoo in the 105th over, the boundary took him past his previous best of 169; it was his 50th run through the covers. A sign of how well he batted came in how, in the 113th over, he played perhaps the only ungainly shot of his innings, a half-sweep across the line to deep midwicket. Turned out he had picked the rare wrong'un from Bishoo, and was actually playing with the spin.No Test double is easy, but in the last over before lunch, Kohli strolled to one of the more inevitable ones with an easy single off a short offbreak.

"North Sound, Antigua and Barbuda: Virat Kohli stroked a commanding 12th Test century to put India in control at 302 for four when stumps were drawn on the opening day of the first Test against the West Indies on Thursday.Having chosen to bat first on winning the toss, the Indian captain led the way with a thoroughly authoritative innings of 143 not out, decorated with 16 fours that has so far occupied just over four hours off 197 deliveries.He put on 105 for the third wicket with Shikhar Dhawan, the opening batsman missing out on a three-figure innings of his own when he fell lbw for 84 sweeping at Devendra Bishoo on the stroke of the tea interval.Bishoo ended the day with figures of three for 108 off 27 overs. Surprisingly he was not called upon by his captain, Jason Holder, in the first period of play, when even debutant batsman and part-time off-spinner Roston Chase delivered eight overs.However his dismissal of Pujara via a horribly miscued pull in the first over after lunch ushered in Kohli who proceeded to transform the rest of the day into a testament to his ever-increasing stature as a batsman of the highest class.Gabriel removed Murali Vijay for just seven after half-an-hours play when the right-hander fended at a lifting delivery for Kraigg Brathwaite to take the catch at the second attempt at second slip.Pujara looked untroubled on joining Dhawan at the crease with the pair putting on 60 before the middle-order players error of judgement at the start of the afternoon session.Having opted to go into the match without uncapped fast-medium bowler Miguel Cummins, the only other pace threat available in the West Indies pre-match squad of 13, it was left to Holder, fellow medium-pacer Carlos Brathwaite and Chase to do the bulk of the early work in support of Gabriel before Bishoo got into his work after lunch.Early in his innings, Kohli passed 3,000 career Test runs and later on reached 1,000 as Test captain. But the most important figures were the partnerships built around his excellent innings.His century stand with Dhawan was followed by a further 60 put together with Rahane followed by a fifth-wicket stand so far worth 66 with Ravichandran Ashwin.With two Test centuries against the West Indies on the Indian sub-continent, the lower-order player will resume on the second morning unbeaten on 22 alongside Kohli.While the West Indies have packed their side with batting, India opted for a bowling attack comprising three pacers and two spinners, omitting Ravindra Jadeja in preference for Amit Mishra to work in tandem with Ashwin as specialist slow bowlers.West Indies have not defeated India in Test cricket for 14 years since the end of the 2002 series in the Caribbean and are the decided underdogs for the first meeting with these opponents on home soil for five years.",7/22/2016,Kohli puts India in charge with 12th Test century,cricket,NORTH SOUND,Bishoo;Vijay;Jadeja;Rahane;Brathwaite;Miguel;Devendra Bishoo;Murali Vijay;Ravindra Jadeja;Amit Mishra;Ravindra;Roston Chase;Jason;Shikhar Dhawan;Virat;Kraigg;Miguel Cummins;Roston;Mishra;Holder;Kraigg Brathwaite;Cummins;Amit;Jason Holder;Chase;Virat Kohli;Kohli;Shikhar;Devendra;Ashwin;Dhawan;Carlos Brathwaite;Gabriel;Carlos;Murali,Kohli;Virat Kohli,

"MANCHESTER: Alastair Cook and Joe Root overcame the early loss of Alex Hales to leave England well-placed on 95 for one at lunch on the first day of the second Test against Pakistan at Old Trafford on Friday.Cook, who marked his 50th Test as England captain by winning the toss, was 40 not out and Root unbeaten on 41, with the hosts looking to bounce back from losing last weeks first Test at Lords.Englands second-wicket partnership was so far worth 70 runs after Hales was bowled by a superb Mohammad Amir delivery for 10.<br/>Predictably, there were a few jeers as Amir prepared to bowl the first ball of the match.Amir, who took the last wicket in Pakistans win in the first of this four-Test series, saw his first and second deliveries edged through gully for four by Cook.<br/>Amir, one of three left-arm quicks in Pakistans attack with Rahat and Wahab Riaz, had Hales dropped in the gully on six by Asad Shafiq, the ball speeding away to third man for four.But three balls later, having repeatedly moved the ball away from Hales, Amir skilfully swung the ball back into the right-handed opener.The delivery also cut off the seam a touch and knocked over Haless middle and off stumps. England were now 25 for one after seven overs.Leg-spinner Yasir Shah, Englands tormentor-in-chief at Lords with 10 wickets, saw his second ball Friday cut in front of point by Root for four. That shot brought up Englands fifty in 92 balls with 10 boundaries.Root, in the manner of Yorkshire and England great Geoffrey Boycott, forced both Wahab Riaz and Amir through cover-point off the back foot for fours as he and his skipper looked to make the most of an even-paced pitch in sunny conditions ideal for batting.

"OLD TRAFFORD: Pakistan and England will clash today at Old Trafford as the hosts will be keen on leveling the series after their 75-run loss at Lord's to Pakistan.Pakistan have reportedly made no changes to their squad after the first Test match at Lord's. However, England have recalled fast bowler James Anderson in a bid to skittle Pakistani batsmen and level the series after their loss at Lord's to Pakistan.Yasir Shah will also be part of the squad after news started doing the rounds that the leg-spinner had encountered a minor injury during practice. Yasir was instrumental in Pakistan's first win at Lord's due to his impressive 10-wicket haul.

"BRASILIA: Brazil arrested 10 people on Thursday suspected of belonging to a poorly organised group supporting Islamic State (IS) and discussing terrorist acts during the next month's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.The group, described as ""absolutely amateur"" by Justice Minister Alexandre Moraes, were all Brazilian citizens and in contact via messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Telegram. They did not know each other personally, the minister said.The arrests came a week after a truck massacre in Nice, France, and amid growing fears of a possible attack when the first Olympics to be held in South America kicks off on Aug. 5. Some 500,000 visitors are expected to travel to Brazil for the Games, many of them from the United States.Although Brazil has no history of conflict with known militant groups, Moraes said the Games had made the Latin American country a more likely target, particularly because of participation by countries fighting IS.""Today was the first operation against a supposed terrorist cell in Brazil,"" he told a news conference. ""Brazil was not part of the coalition against IS but, because of the upcoming Olympics and because it will receive many foreigners, Brazil has become a target.""Moraes said the individuals detained on Thursday were being monitored because they had accessed websites linked to IS, but the group had ""no preparation at all"" and was a ""disorganized cell"". He said that authorities intervened when the group started planning actions including martial-arts training and the purchase of firearms.While the group did not have direct contact with IS, some members had made ""pro forma"" declarations of allegiance to the militant Islamist group via social media, the minister said.A presidential aide said on Thursday that Brazilian police and intelligence services had cooperated with French, German, British, Israeli and U.S. intelligence agencies in the arrests.Brazil's federal police are monitoring around 100 people for possible links to terrorist groups, mostly in the lawless tri-border region with Paraguay and Argentina, said the aide, requesting anonymity.""Brazil was really being preemptive in this case,"" said Scott Stewart, vice president of tactical analysis at Stratfor, a global intelligence and advisory firm. ""There are some tactical benefits to arrests like this...You could disrupt anything in the works and it may also give other people pause.""strong>OPERATION HASHTAG</strongBrazil plans to deploy about 85,000 soldiers, police and other security personnel during the Rio Games, more than twice as many in place for the London Olympics in 2012.It will also operate a joint security centre where representatives from more than 100 countries are expected to help share intelligence and monitor the event.Local media raised concern that the arrests might affect ticket sales for the Games, with the release of 100,000 tickets on Thursday aimed at improving attendance.The local Olympic organising committee, Rio 2016, referred requests for comment to the federal government.Moraes said there was no evidence that the group had acquired weapons though one member had contacted a clandestine weapons site in neighbouring Paraguay that sells AK-47 assault rifles.""Those involved participated in an online group denominated 'the defenders of Sharia' and were planning to acquire weapons to commit crimes in Brazil and even overseas,"" Moraes said.Two people will be brought in for questioning, including the head of a local NGO, in addition to the 10 people arrested across as many states, Moraes added.Federal Judge Marcos Josegrei da Silva, who approved the arrests from the southern city of Curitiba, said police had 30 days to analyse evidence. He emphasized that no-one had been charged in the operation, codenamed Hashtag.""These are internet affirmations on social networks,"" Josegrei told a news conference. ""Not everything a person conceives of in the virtual world is carried out in the real world.""Interim President Michel Temer called an emergency cabinet meeting following the arrests, the first under Brazil's tough new anti-terrorism law approved this year.Brazilian and U.S. officials have raised concern over the disappearance of former Guantanamo Bay detainee Jihad Diyab, after he had resettled in neighbouring Uruguay, saying he could now be in Brazil.Last week, Brazil deported a French-Algerian nuclear physicist convicted by a Paris court in 2012 for his involvement in helping to plot an attack in France in 2009 with an al Qaeda militant in Algeria.Brazil's intelligence agency said on Tuesday it was investigating all threats to the Rio Olympics, after a previously unknown Brazilian Islamist group calling itself ""Ansar al-Khilafah Brazil"" pledged allegiance to IS. It was unclear whether those detained on Thursday have any relation with that group.On Wednesday, SITE Intelligence Group, a U.S. company that monitors the internet, said alleged Islamist militants were giving advice for lone actors to carry out attacks during the Games, including the use of toy drones. The messages are being sent via the mobile messaging system Telegram, SITE said.Stratfor's Stewart said that, with no ability to project terrorist operatives into Brazil, IS could only seek to encourage grassroots groups. Brazil has one of the world's largest Arab diasporas, mostly Christians of Syrian and Lebanese origins.After last week's attack in Nice, France, Brazilian authorities said they would step up security measures for the Games by adding further roadblocks and cordons and frisking more visitors in Rio de Janeiro.

"ANTIGUA: Captain Virat Kohli compiled an unbeaten century to put India in a commanding position on the first day of the opening test against West Indies in Antigua on Thursday.Kohli was on 143 at the close of play, his 12th test century, as the visitors reached 302 for four.He shared a 105-run stand for the third wicket with opener Shikhar Dhawan (84) while Ravichandran Ashwin was 22 not out at stumps.Kohli was rarely beaten in the 197 balls he faced, scoring freely on both sides of the wicket with a rich array of strokes as he posted his second highest test score and moved in sight of a career-best 169.The West Indies bowlers toiled hard for little reward on a flat pitch at the Vivian Richards Stadium in North Sound.Leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo was the pick of the attack, taking three for 108 in 27 overs, though two of his scalps came off short balls that induced poor shots.Captain Jason Holder decided not to take the new ball before stumps, perhaps figuring he and fellow paceman Shannon Gabriel were too tired to make good use of it.Earlier, India won the toss and batted but were in early trouble when opener Murali Vijay was dismissed for seven in the seventh over.Vijay could only fend at a sharply-rising Gabriel delivery, sending an easy catch to second slip Kraigg Brathwaite who juggled the ball before grabbing it safely.West Indies picked up a second wicket shortly after lunch when Bishoo, with his fourth delivery, had Cheteshwar Pujara caught at point for 16 off a leading edge.Bishoo struck again with the last ball before tea when he deceived Dhawan with a well-flighted delivery, hitting the left-hander on the front pad as the batsman tried to sweep.It was an easy lbw decision for umpire Aleem Dar, with a TV replay showing the ball pitched in line and would have crashed into middle stump.Ajinkya Rahane (22) was the only batsman dismissed in the final session, caught at mid-wicket off Bishoo.Though he fell short of his century, Dhawan was pleased with the way he survived at the crease for so long.""In the first session when Gabriel was bowling really good and quick I knew I had to take the punches,"" Dharwan said in an on-field interview.""I was happy I (showed) persistence and patience to keep on going.""India are playing only five specialist batsmen while West Indies have loaded up with batsmen and all-rounders, probably paying the price as they lacked front-line bowling options.",7/22/2016,Centurion Kohli makes big noise in North Sound,cricket,ANTIGUA,Bishoo;Vijay;Dharwan;Brathwaite;Shannon;Shannon Gabriel;Devendra Bishoo;Murali Vijay;Ravichandran;Jason;Shikhar Dhawan;Virat;Kraigg;Aleem;Holder;Kraigg Brathwaite;Aleem Dar;Cheteshwar;Ravichandran Ashwin;Pujara;Jason Holder;Virat Kohli;Dar;Kohli;Shikhar;Ashwin;Devendra;Dhawan;Gabriel;Cheteshwar Pujara;Murali,,

"WASHINGTON: Frances Gael Monfils, seeking his first ATP crown outside Europe, and Ivo Karlovic, nearing titles in consecutive weeks at age 37, advanced to the ATP and WTA Washington Open final in sweltering conditions Saturday.The 29-year-old Frenchman, whose most recent of five career titles came in 2014 at Montpellier, ripped ill German teen Alexander Zverev 6-4, 6-0 in one hour.Croatias 35th-ranked Karlovic fired 14 aces to defeat US fifth seed Steve Johnson 6-4, 6-4 in a match where temperatures on the court reached 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 Celsius).Monfils has split four career ATP matches against Karlovic, winning their most recent meeting at Madrid in 2011 but losing their only prior hardcourt matchup in 2009 at Cincinnati.Karlovic, averaging 20 aces a match, has not surrendered a service break this week.Zverev, ranked a career-best 27th but sick with food poisoning, warned Monfils could test Karlovic with quick returns.Monfils, who seeks his first outdoor crown since Sopot in 2005, is 5-19 in ATP finals, including a 2011 loss at Washington to Radek Stepanek.Karlovic, 7-8 in ATP finals, won his seventh career title last week on Newport grass to become the oldest tour singles champion since 1979.Zverev, 19, smacked a forehand long to surrender the first set in 24 minutes and Monfils rolled from there.Belgian seventh seed Yanina Wickmayer, a 2009 US Open semi-finalist, battled through the heat to oust Kazakh sixth seed Yulia Putintseva 6-4, 6-2.<br/> Wickmayer seeks her fifth WTA title Sunday against Americas 122nd-ranked Lauren Davis, a 6-2, 6-3 winner over 173rd-rated American Jessica Pegula.Karlovic broke in the third game of the match and took the first set in 38 minutes, ending it like the second with back-to-back aces.In the third game of the second set, Karlovic rocketed a service return forehand winner past Johnson and then dropped a slice backhand winner on the line to break for a 2-1 lead.",7/24/2016,Monfils to face Karlovic in Washington fi,tennis,WASHINGTON,Gael;Alexander;Steve Johnson;Ivo;Yulia Putintseva;Frances Gael Monfils;Radek Stepanek.Karlovic;Alexander Zverev;Davis;Monfils;Karlovic;Wickmayer;Jessica Pegula.Karlovic;Ivo Karlovic;Yulia;Yanina Wickmayer;Stepanek.Karlovic;Jessica;Frances;Pegula.Karlovic;Johnson;Putintseva;Lauren Davis;Lauren;Radek;Steve;Zverev;Yanina,Monfils;Karlovic;Frances Gael Monfils;Ivo Karlovic,Montpellier;Americas;WTA Washington Open;ATP
"North Sound, Antigua and Barbuda: West Indies were facing the prospect of another huge series-opening defeat at 21 for one in their second innings at stumps, a deficit of 302 runs, after being forced to follow-on on the third day of the first Test against India on Saturday.Fast-medium bowlers Umesh Yadav and Mohammed Shami took four wickets each to wreck the home sides first innings, dismissing them for 243 in the final session of the day with half-centuries by opener Kraigg Brathwaite and wicketkeeper-batsman Shane Dowrich representing the only meaningful resistance.Brathwaite, who defied Indias array of pace and spin for almost five hours in getting to 74, could not survive the first over of the second turn at the crease, being trapped palpably leg-before by Ishant Sharma.""It was a decent knock in the first innings but I would have loved to go on,"" said Brathwaite at the close of play.""With three out-and-out pacers and two spinners, the Indians have a lot to choose from. They stuck to their plans very well. It was never easy batting against them.""Rajendra Chandrika and Darren Bravo survived to the close and will resume on the fourth day hoping to put up a much more concerted effort than in the first innings.In their previous three Test series, the West Indies lost the opening matches at home to Australia by nine wickets a year ago and then by an innings in Sri Lanka and Australia at the end of 2015.Indias bowlers made a mockery of all the lamentations of a placid, lifeless pitch over the first two days with an impressive, purposeful effort throughout the day.They were held up though at the start of play as Braithwaite and nightwatchman Devendra Bishoo frustrated Virat Kohli and his men for 75 minutes until leg-spinner Amit Mishra had Bishoo stumped by wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha.It was second of six dismissals for Saha in the innings, putting him alongside Syed Kirmani and Mahendra Singh Dhoni for the most dismissals by an Indian wicketkeeper in a Test innings.From that point on it became a virtual procession of West Indies batsmen to and from the wicket with Shami outstanding either side of the lunch interval when he disposed of Bravo, Marlon Samuels and Jermaine Blackwood to add to his dismissal of Chandrika late on the second evening.Debutant Roston Chase displayed a measure of grit in a 47-run stand for the sixth wicket with Brathwaite, but the reintroduction of Yadav for another spell in mid-afternoon proved telling.Chase miscued an attempted pull to give Kohli a simple catch at short midwicket and Brathwaite could not get out of the way of a sharp lifter to give a catch behind.Dowrich counter-attacked superbly in getting to an unbeaten 57 with ten fours by the time the innings folded, Yadav dispensing with Jason Holder and Carlos Brathwaite off successive balls before Mishra completed the job by bowling a heaving Shannon Gabriel.",7/24/2016,India push wilting Windies to verge of heavy def,cricket,NORTH SOUND,Umesh Yadav;Shane;Syed;Shannon;Shannon Gabriel;Devendra Bishoo;Darren;Ishant Sharma;Jermaine;Kirmani;Jason;Virat;Umesh;Saha.It;Mahendra;Dhoni;Mahendra Singh Dhoni;Syed Kirmani;Rajendra;Virat Kohli;Samuels;Kohli;Devendra;Marlon Samuels;Marlon;Gabriel;Bravo;Bishoo;Rajendra Chandrika;Brathwaite;Amit Mishra;Singh;Dowrich;Ishant;Kraigg;Jermaine Blackwood;Yadav;Mishra;Wriddhiman;Mohammed Shami;Kraigg Brathwaite;Blackwood;Holder;Amit;Mohammed;Shami;Darren Bravo;Jason Holder;Wriddhiman Saha.It;Sharma;Chandrika;Carlos Brathwaite;Shane Dowrich;Braithwaite;Carlos,,Saha;Indians
"LONDON: Britains double Olympic champion Mo Farah produced a devastating 5,000m display on Saturday at the Diamond League event in London to prove he is in top form heading into the Rio Olympics.The 33-year-old showed exactly why he is the favourite to defend his two Olympic titles in Brazil next month with a stunning example of speed and stamina at the Olympic stadium.His time of 12 minutes and 59.29 seconds was the fastest mark of the year, and the fourth time in his career that he has dipped under 13 minutes.Most ominously for those trying to catch him, particularly the Kenyans, this was his fastest time in the discipline since before the London 2012 Olympics.Farah made his move after 3600m and never looked back, making the final 1400m appear almost like celebratory laps of honour. He crossed the finishing line by doing his trademark Mobot celebration.Fellow Briton Andrew Butchart was second in a time of 13:14.85, with American Bernard Lagat third in a seasons best 13:14.96.""This is amazing, I got amazing support from the crowd,"" said Farah.

"PALLEKELE, Sri Lanka: David Richardson, the International Cricket Council (ICC) chief, on Monday, handed Steve Smith the ICC Test Championship mace and US$1million in prize money for Australia finishing as the top-ranked Test nation in the 12-month window.""The mace is a symbol of excellence and recognition of a side's outstanding achievement in the toughest format of the sport. Australia's winning performances have been exceptional and they thoroughly deserve to be awarded the mace."" said Mr Richardson.""These are exciting times for Test cricket as the top four ranked countries are involved in high profile series across three different continents showcasing the very best this format of the sport has to offer. I am sure the incentive of achieving the number-one ranking will further motivate them, bringing out the best in the players,"" added Mr Richardson.Australia, under Smith's leadership, won 10 Tests in the 12-month period as on the cut-off date of April 1. On receiving the mace, a pleased Smith said: ""It is a huge honour to be the number-one ranked Test side in the world and the credit should go to all the work the players and support staff have put in over the last 12 months.""I am really proud of our young team and what we have accomplished so far but there is still more we would like to achieve. We now need to put in consistent performances, both at home and away, to continue to be successful and keep the number-one ranking.""Winning away from home has often been a challenge for us, especially in sub-continental conditions, but this is something we are looking to change in this upcoming series against Sri Lanka,"" concluded Smith.Given the small margin of gap between the top-four sides, several permutations exist for India, Pakistan and England to usurp Australia. Second-placed India (112) are breathing down Australia's neck with just six points separating the two teams. Pakistan are third on 111, while England lie fourth, on 108 points. To keep a hold on the top spot, Australia need at least a 1-0 win over Sri Lanka, and need England to beat Pakistan in at least one Test.For India to pip Australia, however, they will need to beat West Indies 4-0 and hope the England-Pakistan series ends in a draw and also Sri Lanka wins by 1-0 or a better margin.Pakistan can claim the top spot for the first time in history if they beat England and Sri Lanka beats Australia.For England, it seems a bit of an uphill climb as, they will need to beat Pakistan in the remaining three Tests, apart from needing West Indies to beat India in at least one Test. They'll also need Sri Lanka to beat Australia.",7/25/2016,Steve Smith receives ICC Test Championship mace in Kandy,cricket,PALLEKELE,David Richardson;Mr;Smith;Mr Richardson.Australia;Richardson;Steve;Richardson.Australia;David;Steve Smith,Steve Smith,International Cricket Council;ICC
"MANCHESTER: James Anderson struck twice on his Lancashire home ground as England eyed a series-levelling win in the second Test against Pakistan at Old Trafford on Monday.Pakistan were 47 for two at lunch on the fourth day, needing a further 518 runs to reach their unlikely victory target of 565.Anderson, Englands all-time leading wicket-taker, removed both Shan Masood (one) and Azhar Ali (eight) in a spell of two wickets for four runs in eight balls.<br/> Mohammad Hafeez was 24 not out and Younis Khan 12 not out.Left-handed opener Masood fell to Anderson for the sixth time in Tests when he edged the paceman straight to England captain Alastair Cook at first slip.Anderson, returning to Test cricket after missing Pakistans 75-run win in the series opener at Lords with a shoulder injury, then had Azhar plumb lbw as the batsman aimed across the line to leave Pakistan 25 for two.They should have been 32 for three when Younis, then on three, edged all-rounder Ben Stokes only for the normally reliable Cook to drop a seemingly routine two-handed slip chance.Earlier, Cook (76 not out) and Joe Root (71 not out) took England to 173 for one in their second innings before the skipper declared.England, already with a huge lead of 489 runs, resumed on 98 for one after Cook had decided against enforcing the follow-on on Sunday.Cook, who scored 105 in Englands mammoth first innings 589 for eight declared, was 49 not out and vice-captain Root, whose Test-best 254 was the cornerstone of that total, 23 not out.Left-handed opener Cook cover-drove Rahat Ali for the seventh boundary of his innings to complete a 55-ball fifty. It was his fastest in Tests, surpassing a 56-ball effort against India in Mohali in 2008.Root struck three legside fours in four balls from left-arm quick Rahat before another boundary, a slog-sweep off leg-spinner Yasir Shah, took him to a 38-ball fifty.Roots 10th four, a reverse sweep off Azhar, saw Englands second-wicket duo complete a century partnership.

"PALLEKELE, Sri Lanka: Australian captain Steve Smith named spin twins Nathan Lyon and Steve OKeefe in his line-up Monday for the series opener against Sri Lanka as the newly-crowned kings of Test cricket look to cement their supremacy.On the day that Australia were presented with the mace as the world number one side, Smith took the unusual move of naming his starting XI a day before the start of the first Test in Pallekele, near Kandy.Australias rise up the rankings has been based in large part on the performance of their fast bowlers such as Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood and they rarely field more than one spinner.But after taking 10 wickets in a warm-up last week, OKeefe has been picked to play only his third Test alongside the more experienced Nathan Lyon -- his close friend and Sheffield Shield teammate.""Both our spinners bowled well in the practice game. They have played lot of games for New South Wales and they are close friends. Its going to be exciting,"" Smith told reporters in Pallekele, on the outskirts of Kandy.Australia have hired local spin legend Muttiah Muralitharan as a consultant for the series, well aware of Sri Lankas reputation for producing turning pitches.Smith said that cracks had already appeared on the Pallekele strip which should also benefit Sri Lankas premier spinner Rangana Herath.""The wicket will take spin for sure here. Not sure about the first innings, but it looks very dry and lots of cracks on it. It certainly will help spin bowlers,"" Smith added.""They (Sri Lanka) have some quality spinners in their rank led by Rangana Herath. He has done really well in these conditions.

"COLOMBO: Sri Lankas cricket board lodged a complaint Monday with the visiting Australians after their bowling consultant and local legend Muttiah Muralitharan was involved in a bust-up with his former colleagues.On the eve of the first of three Tests, board president Thilanga Sumathipala accused Muralitharan of insulting Sri Lanka team manager Charith Senanayake in a row over the Australians use of a practice pitch in Colombo.""Muralitharans behaviour is unacceptable and we have brought this to the notice of the Australian team management,"" Sumathipala told reporters.""It should not have happened. We are very disappointed.""Sumathipala said Muralitharan had bullied groundsmen at the Pallekele Stadium on Saturday into allowing the Australians to practise there when it was theoretically off limits to both teams.""He rode roughshod over the groundsmen and got his (Australian) players to practise in violation of the time stipulations,"" Sumathipala said. ""He later confronted our team manager (Senanayake) and abused him.""Muralitharan is a national hero in Sri Lanka after taking 800 Test wickets, still a world record some six years after his retirement.But his decision to lend his local expertise to the tourists has raised eyebrows, not least because the 44-year-old was once labelled a ""chucker"" by Australias then-prime minister John Howard.Stung by criticism on social media, Muralitharan recently posted a video on YouTube in which he defended his decision to help the Australians as a freelance bowling consultant.""I am doing a professional job,"" said the 44-year-old former spinner.""I am not a traitor.

The way we finished the test, it all panned out pretty nicely.""While Kohli has led India to a test series win in Sri Lanka and beat South Africa 3-0 at home, their record outside South Asia in the longest format has been poor.They have lost series in South Africa, New Zealand, England and Australia on tours since late 2013, something new coach Anil Kumble has said he wants to rectify.The 27-year-old Kohli replaced Mahendra Singh Dhoni as India's test captain after the wicketkeeper-batsman retired from that form of cricket during the tour of Australia in late 2014.Kohli wants his side, who are currently second behind Australia on the International Cricket Council test rankings, to target consistency as well as wins.""If we have a chance to win 4-0, then why not,"" Kohli said. ""We don't need to get complacent. If we end up getting a 2-0 lead, it's not that we would be playing for a draw in the next two tests.""As we know, if we learn to win test matches, then we'll learn how to win tests everywhere.""We will learn how to play in different situations and we will know exactly what to do when a certain situation is going a certain way.""",7/25/2016,Virat Kohli targets period test dominati,cricket,MUMBAI,Kumble;Mahendra;Dhoni;Mahendra Singh Dhoni;Anil;Virat Kohli;Kohli;Singh;Virat;Anil Kumble,Virat Kohli,International Cricket Council
"HARARE: Zimbabwe strike bowler Tendai Chatara has been ruled out of the test series against New Zealand after hurting his ankle, Zimbabwe Cricket announced on Monday.The 25-year-old was expected to spearhead the home side's attack in two tests in Bulawayo, starting on Thursday.He injured his ankle bowling for Zimbabwe A on the first day of their three-day match against the tourists in Harare which finished in an easy 259-run win for New Zealand on Sunday.Chatara, who fractured his leg playing a casual game of soccer last year, will be replaced in the Zimbabwe squad by Michael Chinouya, 30, who has only two one-day internationals to his name.Chatara is the second Zimbabwe seamer to be ruled out after Tinashe Panyangara also failed to recover from a back problem in time for the series.Zimbabwe will be playing their first test series in almost 20 months.

"MUMBAI: India's Narsingh Yadav has claimed his supplements and water had been ""sabotaged"" after the wrestler due to represent his country in the 74kg category at next month's Rio Games tested positive for a banned steroid.The 26-year-old's samples from an out-of-competition test returned positive and the wrestler attended a hearing to present his case before an anti-doping disciplinary panel on Saturday.The panel has asked the national anti-doping agency (NADA) for further details on the case and is expected to return a verdict within a week.Yadav, who secured India a berth at the Games by winning a bronze medal at last year's world championships in Las Vegas, said he had undergone around 25-30 drugs tests in his 15-year career as a professional freestyle wrestler.""I have come out clean every time and never have any of my samples returned positive results,"" he said in a statement.""I have undergone three tests in the last month and a half.""I appeared for a dope test on the second of June before leaving for a training camp in Bulgaria. I was again tested on my return on the 25th of June and once again on the fifth of July.""Yadav's Olympic berth was put in jeopardy when Sushil Kumar, who won bronze in the 66kg category in Beijing in 2008 and silver in London, moved up a weight and sought a court order for a bout between the pair to determine who should go to Rio.Last month, the Delhi High Court ruled against Kumar, the only Indian athlete to win two individual Olympic medals, clearing the way for Yadav to compete in Rio.The qualification row divided opinion in the country and Yadav was provided police security, a rare measure for an Indian athlete, at the Sports Authority of India training centre at Sonepat due to possible threats to his life.The Wrestling Federation of India has also not dismissed the possibility of the failed test coming as a result of subversion, according to local media.""I believe that there is foul play involved in this entire episode,"" said Yadav, who won gold at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. ""Someone has sabotaged my food supplements and water intake.""I am a responsible athlete with an understanding of the country's expectations and hopes on me. I would never dream of betraying that hope.""NADA Director General Navin Agarwal confirmed that the wrestler's room mate and training partner, Sandeep Yadav, has also tested positive for the same substance, which Indian media has reported to be the banned anabolic steroid methandienone.""The foul play allegations are out of our jurisdiction,"" Agarwal told Reuters by telephone.

"PALLEKELE, Sri Lanka: Australia removed Sri Lankan opener Kusal Perera cheaply after building up an 86-run first innings lead over their hosts as they took firm command Wednesday of a low-scoring Test in Pallekele.Perera fell to the last ball of the day, with the umpires once again forced to call a premature halt to proceedings following a downpour at the picturesque ground on the outskirts of Kandy.Australia were all out for 203 in reply to Sri Lankas first innings total of 117, with spinner Lakshan Sandakan taking four wickets on his debut.The early loss of Perera on the second day of the first Test was another bitter blow for the struggling hosts.Perera fell for just four when he was lbw to paceman Mitchell Starc, leaving Sri Lanka wobbling on six for one at close of play.The downpour initially prompted the umpires to call an early tea break, but they were later forced to abandon play early for the second day running.Veteran Sri Lankan left-arm spinner Rangana Herath and the 25-year-old rookie Sandakan had earlier taken four wickets apiece as the Australian batsman also struggled to cope with a turning pitch.Adam Voges top-scored for the Australians with 47, meaning no player from either side managed to score a half-century in the first innings.And with the pitch showing no sign of respite, the Australians first innings lead could well prove decisive as they try to cement their position as Test crickets number one side.The 38-year-old Herath, who has hinted that he may soon retire from Test cricket, was the pick of the bowlers and was unlucky not to record a five-wicket haul.He dismissed both overnight batsmen -- skipper Steve Smith and Usman Khawaja -- in successive overs and had a third wicket in the morning session when wicketkeeper Peter Nevill was caught at mid-on.While Herath was providing captain Angelo Mathews both the attacking and containing options, Sandakan ran through the lower order to finish with four for 58.Seamer Nuwan Pradeep finished with two wickets, including that of the resolute Voges who was brilliantly caught by Kusal Mendis at gully.Voges, who faced 115 deliveries and hit three fours, added 60 for the fifth wicket with Mitchell Marsh, who was among Sandakans victims.",7/27/2016,Rain abandon play early as Aussies take command over Sri L,cricket,PALLEKELE,Mathews;Lakshan;Mitchell Starc;Kusal;Mitchell Marsh;Angelo;Kusal Perera;Usman Khawaja;Peter Nevill;Rangana;Kusal Mendis;Angelo Mathews;Mitchell;Sandakan;Steve Smith;Nuwan;Herath;Nuwan Pradeep;Smith;Nevill;Rangana Herath;Pradeep;Lakshan Sandakan;Voges;Steve;Starc;Marsh;Peter;Khawaja;Perera;Usman;Mendis,,

"RIO de JANEIRO: Roger Federer has pulled out of the Rio Olympics and will miss the rest of the season, including the U.S. Open, because he needs ""more extensive rehabilitation"" to prolong his career after knee surgery earlier this year.Last month he described how ""one stupid move"" sparked a chain of bad luck - which resulted in left knee surgery in February and sitting out the French Open with a back injury - culminating in Tuesday's decision to end his wretched season.""Im extremely disappointed to announce that I will not be able to represent Switzerland at the Olympic Games in Rio and that I will also miss the remainder of the season,"" the 17-times grand slam champion said on his Facebook page.""Considering all options after consulting with my doctors and my team, I have made the very difficult decision to call an end to my 2016 season as I need more extensive rehabilitation following my knee surgery earlier this year.""The doctors advised that if I want to play on the ATP World Tour injury free for another few years, as I intend to do, I must give both my knee and body the proper time to fully recover. It is tough to miss the rest of the year.""For much of his career, the former world number one had been blessed with a body that seemed bullet-proof against the aches, pains and injuries suffered by most top athletes.But one false move by the man known for his gliding footwork, while running a bath for his twin daughters following his Australian Open semi-final loss, means he would have gone a whole season without a title for the first time since 2000.Now aged 34, Tuesday's announcement also probably ended the 2012 silver medallist's hopes of ever winning an Olympic singles title.""The silver lining is that this experience has made me realise how lucky I have been throughout my career with very few injuries,"" said Federer, who won an Olympic doubles gold with Stan Wawrinka in 2008.""The love I have for tennis, the competition, tournaments and... the fans remains intact. I am as motivated as ever and plan to put all my energy towards coming back strong, healthy and in shape to play attacking tennis in 2017.""strong>KNEE TROUBLE</strongUntil May this year, Federer had appeared in 65 successive grand slam tournaments and the last time he was absent from one of the four majors was at the 1999 U.S. Open.When he reached the last four at Wimbledon, which included winning a five-set thriller in the quarter-finals against Marin Cilic, it appeared as if Federer's injury woes were finally behind him and his absence from the French Open was a one off.However, he was clearly rattled when he landed heavily on his left knee after rolling his ankle during the fifth set of his semi-final defeat by Candaian Milos Raonic at Wimbledon.Although Federer, who was left sprawled face down on the turf following the fall, got up to complete the match, he was worried about the long term effects on his knee.""I just hope with the slip I had in the fifth, I'm going to be fine... I hope I didn't hurt myself,"" the world number three said at the time.""Is it (the pain) a three-day thing, is it a 24-hour thing or is it more? I don't know at this point.""With the body that's been playing up this year, I just hope I'm going to be fine.""It seems his worst fears were realised on Tuesday as he called time on his season after appearing in only seven tournaments and with a 21-7 win-loss record.",7/27/2016,Federer to miss Olympics and rest of season with knee prob,tennis,RIO de JANEIRO,Roger;Federer;Cilic;Stan;Marin;Wawrinka;Roger Federer;Raonic;Milos;Stan Wawrinka;Milos Raonic;Marin Cilic,Federer;Roger Federer,
"MIAMI: The first ever Caribbean Premier League games in Florida could be the launchpad for the United States to have its own T20 cricket franchise, organisers of the tournament said.The six games being held at Lauderhill in South Florida from Thursday to Sunday are the first time that the CPL has branched out from its island bases to the United States.The games will be played at the Central Broward Regional Park, which has the only purpose built cricket stadium in the United States and which held the first full international matches on American soil, two Twenty20 games between New Zealand and Sri Lanka in 2010.Lauderhill is an area with a large population of people of Jamaican heritage while South Florida itself has communities from across the cricket-loving Caribbean region.""There are lots of hoops you have to jump through but if you look at the way America embraces its sport, having a local franchise here makes a lot of sense,"" CPLs chief operating officer Pete Russell said.""It ties you into the local community and makes it a lot more relevant. That would make a lot of sense. There is no issue with putting it into our schedule. But its one step at a time we have to see how these games go, but so far, so good,"" he said.<br/>Some prospective investors in the league have already shown interest in a US franchise, said Russell.""A lot of potential owners have talked to us about it (but) we are mindful of the politics involved here and also in terms of cricket generally. We wouldnt be so presumptuous as to say We are having a franchise here - there are a lot of things you have to consider before you do that. We have had preliminary conversations but no more than saying Wouldnt it be a good idea in the future,"" he added./><strong>International dispute</strong> The CPL features franchises from Jamaica, Barbados, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, St.Lucia and St.Kitts and Nevis and includes international players as well as those drawn from the T20 World Cup winning West Indies team.The progress of cricket in the US has been hampered by administrative problems with the USA Cricket Association (USACA) having been suspended by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in December.The ICC is currently running affairs in the US directly. There have been previous attempts to popularise the sport through games involving retired international stars, playing at baseball venues, but Russell believes the demographics mean there is no real need to convert Americans to the sport.""As well as the Caribbean diaspora, you have the Asian population here who are cricket-starved,"" he added.While no plans for the future have been announced it is unlikely that this weeks games, featuring all six franchises, will be the last time that the CPL features at Lauderhill.""We have invested well over a million dollars in coming to Florida. The stadium is great but to bring it up to international standard with the screens, the lights and the hospitality areas, we have had to invest,"" said CPL chief executive Damien ODonohoe.""We are bringing that Caribbean flavour and feel and it is going to be a very special atmosphere come Saturday and Sunday,"" he added.Lauderhill mayor Richard Kaplan said he is delighted that the games are likely to be well attended with a large contingent of fans travelling down from New York as well as from across the Sunshine State.""I do see the possibility of a franchise, I do see the possibility of numerous long-term relationships in the development of the sport.

"Manchester: England were waiting to discover on Tuesday if they would be without Ben Stokes for the third Test against Pakistan as coach Trevor Bayliss insisted they could cope with the absence of the key all-rounder.Stokes suffered a calf injury while bowling on Monday as England closed in on a mammoth 330-run win in the second Test at Old Trafford to level the four-match series at 1-1.The sight of a grimacing Stokes slowly walking off the field in Manchester suggested that, at the very least, the Durham star would struggle to be fit for the third Test at Birminghams Edgbaston ground which gets underway a week on Wednesday.Doing without Stokes, however, is something England have got used to in a season where he has started only two out of five Tests and has not finished one.A left knee injury cut short Stokess participation in the first Test against Sri Lanka in May and left the 25-year-old needing surgery which saw him miss the final two Tests of that series, as well as the subsequent one-dayers and lone Twenty20.But in Stokess absence, Warwickshires Chris Woakes -- also a pace-bowling all-rounder -- seized the chance to revive an international career that appeared to have come to a halt, producing an impressive series of performances with both bat and ball.Nevertheless, England coach Trevor Bayliss remains well aware of Stokess value to the team.<br/>""If he does miss out, it will give someone else an opportunity,"" said Bayliss at Old Trafford following Englands commanding victory at Lancashires headquarters.""Yes, hes a big player for us -- he adds a lot of spark to the team. ""He bats, bowls and hes a leader in the field -- so it is a bit of a hole. ""But Woakes has done brilliantly so far this season, so we are lucky in that aspect.""/><strong>No Vince guarantee</strong> />England captain Alastair Cook and Joe Root made more than 500 runs between them in Manchester, with vice-captain Root making a Test-best 254 in a first-innings where his skipper posted a century.As Bayliss pointed out, all teams are reliant on their best batsmen. But, ideally, England would like the two other members of their top four, opener Alex Hales and James Vince, to shoulder a larger share of the burden.Hampshire captain Vince has yet to make a Test fifty in seven innings and was once more caught off an edged drive, for 18, at Old Trafford.""I dont see theres any reason to panic just at the moment,"" said Bayliss. ""As I said after the last game, though, runs will count.The Australian added: ""Im sure (Vinces place) will come up for discussion before Edgbaston.<br/>""Yes, Id like to see people given a little bit more of an extra go. But weve never put a quantity on it -- never said five Tests, six Tests, seven Tests, or whatever it might be.""It will be a little bit of a gut feel... if theres someone else that warrants a place to replace a player like that.""Bayliss said Vinces offside problems were comparable to batsmen unable to resist hooking.<br/>""Weve probably all seen it before -- the happy hooker, (you tell him to) give the hook shot away.""It might get you out a few times, but it scores you a lot of runs. So what do you do?<br/>""His cover-drive is one of his better shots.""Weve spoken about it, just letting a few more balls go and let the bowlers come to him before he plays his favourite shot.""Its obviously only a split-second to make that decision, but hes fully aware of it.""",7/27/2016,England prepare for Stokes setb,cricket,Manchester,Hales;Cook;Alastair;Ben Stokes;Chris;Alastair Cook;Warwickshires Chris Woakes;Joe;Alex;Root;James;Ben;Bayliss;Joe Root;Woakes;Vince;Stokes;Warwickshires;Alex Hales;Trevor Bayliss;Trevor;James Vince,,Birminghams Edgbaston

"KANDY: Kusal Mendis struck his maiden test century in a match in which no other batsman has managed a fifty to power Sri Lanka to 253 for five at tea on day three of the first test against Australia on Thursday.The 21-year-old remained unbeaten on 157 -- 40 runs more than what his team managed in the first innings -- after forging the match's first century-plus partnership with Dinesh Chandimal (42) to help the hosts take a handy 167-run lead with five wickets in hand.Dhananjaya de Silva was batting on 24 as Sri Lanka erased the 86-run first innings deficit in the morning before dominating the post-lunch session, adding 137 runs at a run rate of over four for the loss of Chandimal's wicket.Mendis brought up his maiden test century in style, slog-sweeping spinner Steve O'Keefe over mid-wicket for a six, and his blooming sixth wicket partnership with de Silva is already worth 50.The visitors' woes were compounded when spinner O'Keefe hobbled off the ground with Cricket Australia later confirming he has a ""right hamstring issue"" in a tweet.Earlier, resuming on six for one, Sri Lanka received an early jolt with Mitchell Starch trapping Dimuth Karunaratne leg before for the second time in the match with the third delivery of the day.O'Keefe dismissed Kaushal and spin partner Nathan Lyon sent back home captain Angelo Mathews (nine) to reduce Sri Lanka to 86-4.Mendis found an able ally in Chandimal who got a reprieve on 24 when a diving Starc failed to take a return catch.Mitchell Marsh denied Chandimal his fifty but Mendis batted with consummate ease, sweeping the spinners and cutting the pacemen with equal confidence.",7/28/2016,Magnificent Mendis revives Sri Lanka with maiden ,cricket,KANDY,Mathews;de;Kusal;Dimuth;Chandimal;Angelo;Dimuth Karunaratne;Kusal Mendis;Angelo Mathews;Nathan;Steve O'Keefe;O'Keefe;Kaushal;Silva;Lyon;de Silva;Karunaratne;Nathan Lyon;Steve;Dinesh Chandimal;Dinesh;Starc;Keefe;Mendis,Mendis;Kusal Mendis,Mitchell Starch

"BRASILIA: Britain's Andy Murray, bristling with confidence after ending a three-year wait for another grand slam title at Wimbledon, will seek to make history in Brazil by becoming the first man to win successive Olympic gold medals in men's singles tennis.But to replicate his London Olympics triumph Murray will need to find a chink in the armour of Novak Djokovic, the proud Serb who has dominated men's tennis in recent years and now has his eye on the only major honour to elude him.In recent years Murray has struggled to hold his own in the rivalry against childhood friend Djokovic, who defeated him in the 2016 Australian and French Open finals to became the first man since 1969 to hold all four grand slam titles at once.Djokovic's maiden French Open title elevated the Serb, a winner of 12 grand slams, to the pantheon of tennis greats but a lacklustre third-round exit at Wimbledon has offered hope to Murray and his other rivals that his dominance may be ebbing.""Winning medals for your country is as good as it gets,"" said Murray, who in 2012 became the first Briton in 104 years to win a men's singles gold medal at Olympics.Three-time grand slam winner Murray will be hoping to improve on his 24-10 career match record against Djokovic in Brazil, where the two men are favourites to take gold.Roger Federer's hopes of winning a men's singles Olympics gold to go with the doubles title he won in 2008 look to be at an end, however, after the 34-year-old pulled out of Rio -- and the rest of the season -- to undergo rehabilitation on his left knee.In the women's game, 22-time grand slam winner Serena Williams is hot favourite to retain the Olympic singles gold that she won for the first time in 2012.Williams, who won three Olympic doubles gold medals with sister Venus, underscored her dominance of the women's game this month by lifting her seventh Wimbledon title.Germany's Angelique Kerber and Spains Garbine Muguruza have contested the last four grand slam finals against Williams and are expected to be her main challengers in Rio.But Russia's Maria Sharapova, who lost to Williams in the 2012 final, will miss Rio as she is still serving a two-year ban for failing a drugs test.",7/29/2016,Djokovic stands between Murray and second gold,tennis,BRASILIA,Garbine Muguruza;Federer;Murray;Williams;Maria Sharapova;Kerber;Angelique;Sharapova;Novak;Andy Murray;Garbine;Serena Williams;Djokovic;Angelique Kerber;Venus;Novak Djokovic;Rio;Maria;Andy;Muguruza;Serena,Djokovic;Murray;Novak Djokovic;Andy Murray,
"JAMAICA: West Indies have added 19-year-old fast bowler Alzarri Joseph to their squad for the second test against India starting in Jamaica on Saturday.Joseph brings genuine pace to a West Indies attack that struggled for penetration in a lopsided innings and 92-run defeat in the first test in Antigua last week.The Antiguan teenager earned selection after impressing in the under-19 World Cup won by West Indies in February. He bowled the fastest delivery of the tournament, clocked at 143 kilometres per hour.Joseph has played just eight first class matches, picking up 24 wickets at an average of a tad over 24.West Indies veteran Marlon Samuels described Joseph as young, fit, fast and fearless and chairman of selectors Courtney Browne thought the youngster was ready for promotion.""We feel that Alzarri  will now benefit from the professional guidance of our coaching staff and the presence of fast bowling legend Joel Garner as manager,"" Browne said.Josephs addition brings the squad to 14 players, with nobody dropped after the first test, where India piled up 566 for eight declared.Shannon Gabriel was the only genuine quick in that line-up, backed by fast-medium exponents Jason Holder and Carlos Brathwaite.Early reports suggest the pitch at Sabina Park in Kingston may be green and give the fast bowlers some assistance in the second of the four tests in the series.West Indies also underperformed with the bat in the first test, compiling scores of only 243 and 231.Samuels, who scored one and 50, says it is time he raised his test batting to the level of his performances in Twenty20 and One Day Internationals.He averages only 33.39 in test matches, less than his ODI average and not far shy of his Twenty20 average.I havent been getting the runs Ive been looking for in the test arena but Ive been making up in the shorter version, the 35-year-old said.Its up to me to focus more and (put) in some big performance so the team can benefit.He said he felt a lot of pressure and was aware he needed to temper his aggression at times and focus on occupying the crease.Im batting at four, so I have to dominate. The responsibility is great so I have to change my game.",7/29/2016,Windies add teenage paceman Joseph test squad,cricket,JAMAICA,Brathwaite.Early;Alzarri;Browne;Garner;Joel Garner;Jason;Holder;Alzarri Joseph;Courtney Browne;Jason Holder;Joel;Courtney;Samuels;Joseph;Ive;Marlon Samuels;Carlos Brathwaite.Early;Marlon;Gabriel;Carlos,Joseph;Alzarri Joseph,
"KINGSTON, Jamaica: Jermaine Blackwood smashed an entertaining counter-attacking half-century but India held the upper hand in reducing the West Indies to 88 for four at lunch on the opening day of the second Test in Kingston on Saturday.Blackwood, who was in danger of being dropped after a double failure in the innings loss in the first Test in Antigua a week earlier, responded with an electrifying innings of 62 with four sixes and seven fours off 62 deliveries to lift the home side from the depths of seven for three.He completely dominated a fourth-wicket partnership of 81 with Marlon Samuels and offered the sparse opening-day crowd at Sabina Park rich entertainment with a succession of attacking shots off both pacers and spinners.However, his adventurous style always made him vulnerable and he fell in the final over before the interval, adjudged leg-before to Ravichandran Ashwin.Samuels, who was scoreless for 29 deliveries -- in stark contrast to the explosive batting of his fellow Jamaican at the other end -- resumes in the afternoon session on 14 off 71 balls in partnership with Roston Chase.West Indies were made to regret captain Jason Holders decision to bat first on winning the toss as Indias opening bowlers exploited the vulnerability of the hosts top order yet again.Ishant Sharma removed Kraigg Brathwaite and Darren Bravo off successive deliveries in just his second over.With a reputation of susceptibility to the short ball early in his innings clearly on the fast bowlers mind, Brathwaite failed to negotiate a lifting delivery in Sharmas second over and Cheteshwar Pujara held the simple catch at short-leg.Bravos weakness outside the off-stump was then immediately capitalised upon, the left-hander failing to cover a full-length delivery properly for a delighted Indian captain Virat Kohli to take the catch at first slip.Rajendra Chandrika, the other opener, then gave catching practice to Lokesh Rahul at second slip as he guided a lifting delivery from Mohammed Shami unerringly into the hands of the fielder.Rahul was an enforced change to the Indian lineup from the first Test triumph as opening batsman Murali Vijay was ruled out because of a thumb injury sustained in the lead-up to the match.Miguel Cummins is making his Test debut for the West Indies, the 24-year-old fast-medium bowler getting the opportunity at the expense of all-rounder Carlos Brathwaite.",7/30/2016,India put Windies under pressure despite Blackwood,cricket,KINGSTON,Vijay;Brathwaite;Murali Vijay;Darren;Lokesh Rahul;Jermaine;Jason;Virat;Jermaine Blackwood;Kraigg;Rahul;Roston;Mohammed Shami;Blackwood;Kraigg Brathwaite;Mohammed;Shami;Holders;Darren Bravo;Cheteshwar;Lokesh;Pujara;Virat Kohli;Sharma;Samuels;Kohli;Marlon Samuels;Carlos Brathwaite;Marlon;Bravo;Cheteshwar Pujara;Carlos;Jason Holders;Murali,Blackwood;Jermaine Blackwood,
"BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe: Centuries from Ross Taylor and BJ Watling and a three-wicket haul from Trent Boult moved New Zealand closer to a huge win over Zimbabwe in the first Test in Bulawayo on Saturday.After Taylor scored an unbeaten 173 and Watling made 107 in a New Zealand total of 576 for six declared, Boult struck three times in six deliveries to send Zimbabwe crashing to 17 for four in their second innings.Craig Ervines unbeaten 49 helped the hosts recover to 121 for five at the close of day three at Queens Sports Club, but Zimbabwe still need 291 runs to make New Zealand bat again in the match.While the first two days of the game had been distinctly one-sided, the third was even more brutal as Taylor and Watling added 253 for the sixth wicket for New Zealand, who went on to claim four Zimbabwean wickets in the first four overs of their reply.The Black Caps lost nightwatchman Ish Sodhi in the second over of the day as they resumed on 315 for four, but that simply allowed Taylor and Watling to get on with their productive alliance.The pair hardly offered the Zimbabweans a sniff in the four hours that they were together, as Taylor brought up his 14th Test hundred and Watling registered his sixth.They were finally parted five overs after the tea break when Watling pulled a short delivery to deep square-leg, and the dismissal led Kane Williamson to declare with a first-innings lead of 412.The New Zealand bowlers wasted no time in getting stuck into their opponents, as Tim Southee had Hamilton Masakadza caught at slip in the first over and Boult went on the rampage.The left-armer bowled Brian Chari in his first over, then dismissed Chamu Chibhabha and Prince Masvaure with consecutive deliveries in his second.Ervine and Sikandar Raza Butt responded with an entertaining counterattack that saw them put on 69 for the fifth wicket in just nine overs, but Neil Wagner ended the fun when he dismissed Raza for 37 with a short ball.The Zimbabweans were left staring down the barrel of an innings defeat, as the debilitating effects of not playing a Test since November 2014 became increasingly clear.",7/30/2016,Boult strikes hurt Zimbabwe after New Zealand build massive lead,cricket,BULAWAYO,Wagner;Chamu;Kane Williamson;Tim Southee;Kane;Brian Chari;Raza;Williamson;Chari;Hamilton;Chibhabha;Trent;Masakadza;Neil Wagner;Trent Boult;Watling;Ross;Masvaure;Neil;Ish;Chamu Chibhabha;Sikandar;Taylor;Boult;Ross Taylor;Sodhi;Butt;Brian;Sikandar Raza Butt;Ish Sodhi;Tim;Southee;Hamilton Masakadza,Boult;Trent Boult,Queens Sports Club;BJ Watling

"PALLEKELLE, Sri Lanka: Sri Lankan spinner Rangana Herath backed up centurion Kusal Mendis superlative effort to stun top-ranked Australia by 106 runs in the rain-affected first Test in Pallekele on Saturday.Herath, 38, grabbed 5-54 to help the hosts bundle out Australia for 161 on the fifth and final day after they were set a challenging 268 in the second innings.Australian skipper Steven Smith posted a gritty half-century before Steve OKeefe and Peter Nevill frustrated Sri Lanka with a 178-ball partnership.Herath bagged the last Australian wicket to fall by cleaning up OKeefe to trigger wild celebration in the Lankan camp. This was Sri Lankas only second Test win against Australia in 27 matches.It was batsman Mendis (176) who set up the unlikely win for Sri Lanka with his superb maiden ton in his teams second innings after the hosts overcame an 86-run deficit.The 21-year-old Mendis, the only centurion in a low-scoring contest, played a memorable 254-ball knock laced with 21 fours and a six.For Lankan spinners it was a race against time as rain threatened to thwart their chances of upsetting firm favourites Australia but Herath had other ideas in mind.<br/> <br/> The left-arm spinner, who grabbed four wickets in the first innings, made life miserable for the Australian batsmen on a turning track on the fifth morning.Smith, whose 55 was the next best after Mendis century, was trapped LBW by Herath as Australia slipped to 141 for seven at lunch.Debutant chinaman bowler Lakshan Sandakan, who bagged seven wickets in the match, provided the perfect foil to Heraths experience.OKeefe, who was ruled out of the remainder of the series after injuring his hamstring Thursday, surprised the opposition by turning up at the crease Saturday.OKeefe and Nevill resisted stoutly with one eye on the skies but could only delay the inevitable.Sri Lanka lead the three-match series 1-0 as the action shifts to Galle for the second Test beginning August 4.",7/30/2016,Sri Lanka stun top ranked Australia by 106 ru,cricket,PALLEKELE,Herath;Lakshan;Kusal;Smith;Nevill;Rangana Herath;Peter Nevill;Rangana;Kusal Mendis;Steven;Lakshan Sandakan;Steve;Sandakan;Peter;Steven Smith;Mendis,,
"LONDON: Prospects of day/night Test cricket being staged in England moved closer to reality on Friday with a trial announced by Warwickshire next month.The county club will stage one of their Second XI fixtures under lights at Edgbaston.The August 22-24 fixture against Worcestershire 2nd XI has been moved from Barnt Green to Warwickshires Edgbaston headquarters in Birmingham, which has permanent floodlights.Australia won the inaugural day/night Test when they beat New Zealand by three wickets in Adelaide in November last year.Doubts, however, remain about the visibility of the pink ball used in floodlit Tests -- the standard red ball does not show up well under the floodlights and the white ball used for one-day matches could get lost when players are in their traditional whites for Test cricket.There are also particular concerns about whether day/night Tests are necessary in England, when much of the cricket season takes place when the hours of natural daylight are the longest in the year.Nevertheless, England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chairman Colin Graves remains keen on the idea and officials at Lords are keen to look into the subject, as are leading ball manufacturers Dukes and Kookaburra.Both firms will provide a pink ball for the 2nd XI fixture, with each used for two innings of the match, which will be free to the public.Alan Fordham, the ECBs head of cricket operations, said: ""Staging first-class matches under lights with a pink ball is a format which has worked well elsewhere in the cricketing world and its important we consider ways in which we can attract more people to first-class cricket in the long term.""Well be monitoring this trial match closely and we would like to thank Warwickshire for their support in hosting the fixture.""Neil Snowball, Warwickshires chief executive, added: ""The concept of day/night cricket has attracted a large amount of interest around the world and we are keen to support the ECB by exploring the potential for these fixtures in England and Wales.""We have a long tradition of staging day-night cricket on this ground and this trial game will provide valuable insights for everyone interested in broadening the audience for our first class game.""Edgbaston hosted the first ever day/night limited-overs match in Britain in 1997, under temporary lights.But the Birmingham ground now has permanent floodlights and is seen as the most likely venue should England play a home day/night Test.",7/30/2016,DayNight Test in England moves closer with tri,cricket,LONDON,Colin;Snowball;Graves;Colin Graves;Neil Snowball;Dukes;Neil,,Worcestershire 2nd XI;ECB;Wales Cricket Board;Fordham;Warwickshire;ECBs
"LONDON: With one month of the transfer window left remaining, Premier League clubs are poised to push escalating fees closer to another new record this week.The projected move of France midfielder Paul Pogba from Juventus back to Manchester United for a world record one hundred million pounds ($132.3 million) would take spending by the 20 teams to almost 600m, adding to the 175m recorded by accountancy firm Deloitte in the January window.Last year was the first in which annual fees reached one billion pounds.So far this close-season Arsenal -- criticised in the past by many supporters for not spending enough -- have recorded the highest individual outlay by paying 35 million pounds for Swiss midfielder Granit Xhaka.But Pogba's proposed return to Old Trafford would dwarf that and all other sums in the history of the sport, smashing the world record of 85.3 million pounds that Real Madrid paid for Wales forward Gareth Bale three years ago.Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is among those who are bemused by how high fees have risen but still believes there is no longer any limit.""Since I've been in the sport I always thought it can't go any higher up and I've always been wrong,"" he told reporters.""Maybe it will be 200 or 300m, who knows?""Trevor Francis, the first million-pound player in English football back in 1979, said he was surprised the new world record might be set by a midfield player.""I really thought if (100m) was paid, it was going to be for a striker who could be a match-winner and probably provide you with 30 goals a season,"" he told BBC Radio.""Possibly the only two I thought could command that figure were Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi because people realise they are exceptional talents that will go down in the history of the game.""strong>BROADCASTING DEAL</strongWith a lucrative new broadcasting deal coming into effect this season and new managers taking over at Chelsea and the two Manchester clubs, it is perhaps not surprising that a spending spree has materialised.Under Antonio Conte, Italy's head coach at Euro 2016.Chelsea paid more than 30 million pounds for beach of Marseille's Michy Batshuayi and Leicester City's N'Golo Kante.The fee for Kante, who helped Leicester become surprise Premier League champions, clearly illustrated football's inflation rate -- a year ago the midlands club paid barely one-sixth as much for him.Former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was always likely to spend big in attempting to revive Manchester United, with Pogba expected to become his fourth major signing.Ironically, the most exciting of them could be Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who arrived on a free transfer from Paris St Germain and scored a spectacular goal on Saturday four minutes into his debut.Pep Guardiola, having already spent 35 million pounds at Manchester City, was reported by British media on Sunday to be on the verge of almost doubling that by signing German forward Leroy Sane from Schalke 04.At the other end of the spectrum, Burnley and managerless Hull City, two of the newly promoted clubs, have hardly begun recruiting.Once they do over the next 31 days, the amount of money shelled out will only increase.",7/31/2016,Premier League transfer fees poised to break record,football,LONDON,Zlatan;Sane;Ronaldo;Jose Mourinho;Granit Xhaka.But Pogba;Bale;Gareth Bale;Cristiano Ronaldo;Leroy Sane;Antonio;Paul Pogba;Paul;Arsene Wenger;Lionel;Zlatan Ibrahimovic;Batshuayi;Francis;Jose;Gareth;Michy;Antonio Conte;Chelsea;Xhaka.But;Cristiano;Lionel Messi;Mourinho;Kante;Wenger;Ibrahimovic;Michy Batshuayi;Conte;Trevor Francis;Guardiola;Pogba;Arsene;Messi;Leroy;Deloitte;Granit;Trevor,,BBC Radio;Paris St Germain;Schalke;Real Madrid;Marseille;Leicester;Burnley;Juventus;Chelsea;Manchester United;Premier League

"BERLIN: Eighty years after Jesse Owens won four medals at the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, his daughter says Germanys Nazi leader Adolf Hitler refused to shake her fathers hand.The controversial Berlin Olympics opened on August 1, 1936 to much fanfare with Reichs Chancellor Hitler hoping to showcase the best of the Aryan race with the hosts planning to dominate the podium across the 19 different sports events.Owens ruined Hitlers plans as the black American sprinter won gold in the 100 metres, 200m, 4x100m relay and long jump gold over six magical days at Berlins Olympic Stadium.His achievements made a mockery of the Nazi ideology of Aryan supremacy and according to sporting folklore, Hitler refused to shake Owens hand, despite the Americans historic display.Owens died of lung cancer, aged 66, in 1980, but his daughter, Marlene Owens Rankin, says as far as she is concerned, her father never shook Hitlers hand.Owens Rankin said her father always gave one answer when asked whether he was congratulated by Hitler in Berlin, three years before the start of World War II which ended withthe Nazi leaders suicide in the ruins of Berlin in May 1945. ""He always said I didnt go to the Berlin Olympics to shake Hitlers hand,"" the 77-year-old daughter told magazine Sport Bild.<br/>""I went there to run.

"KINGSTON, Jamaica: West Indies captain Jason Holder earned a richly-deserved wicket at the end of an excellent spell of bowling, but India remained firmly in control at 425 for six at lunch on the third day of the second Test at Sabina Park in Jamaica on Monday.That gave the tourists a lead of 229 runs after the home sides meagre first innings total of 196.Ajinkya Rahane survived a searching examination from medium-pacer Holder and benefitted from a dropped chance off leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo to be unbeaten on 74 at the interval.However the West Indies finally enjoyed a bit of success for their discipline and persistence with the ball when wicketkeeper-batsman Wriddhiman Saha was ruled leg-before to Holder for 47 on the stroke of the interval.Their sixth-wicket partnership was worth 98 runs and further solidified Indias already dominant position in the match, even though they were again kept to a pedestrian scoring rate with only 67 runs added in the two hours of play.Holder, who had gone wicketless through 54 overs in the series, troubled Rahane consistently in a nine-over spell after replacing fast bowler Shannon Gabriel 40 minutes into the session.In one particularly testing over, he had three vehement LBW appeals turned down and twice beat the outside edge of the well-set batsman.Bishoo should have claimed a wicket at the other end but Rajendra Chandrika failed to hold on to a low diving effort at backward-point when Rahane, on 65, top-edged an attempted cut.A weather forecast of torrential rain on the fourth day suggests that the Indians may be inclined to pursue quick runs in the days second session and seek to put the West Indies under greater pressure in their second innings by the close of play.",08-01-2016,Holder makes breakthrough but India in contr,cricket,KINGSTON,Saha;Bishoo;Wriddhiman;Holder;Rajendra Chandrika;Rahane;Wriddhiman Saha;Shannon;Shannon Gabriel;Jason Holder;Devendra Bishoo;Rajendra;Ajinkya Rahane;Indias;Chandrika;Devendra;Ajinkya;Jason;Gabriel,,

"TORONTO: World number one Novak Djokovic continued his dominance of Kei Nishikori with a 6-3 7-5 victory in the final of the Rogers Cup in Toronto on Sunday.After clinching his 30th ATP World Tour Masters 1000 title, Djokovic immediately started to turn his attention to something more elusive, an Olympic gold medal.In his first tournament since an upset third round loss to American Sam Querrey on the grass of Wimbledon four weeks ago, Djokovic returned to his winning ways and became the first four-time winner of the Rogers Cup.The 29-year-old Serb seized the opening set in just over 30 minutes, and then dug deep during a spirited back and forth in the final stages of the hardcourt match. Djokovic was bolstered by a strong service performance as he won 82 percent of his first serve points and recorded five aces.""I worked on it (with my coach),"" Djokovic, who struggled on serve earlier in the tournament, said in a courtside interview.""I had to change something, I was not getting many of the free points (as I did today).""It allowed me to be more aggressive. It was my best (serving) performance of the week.With the second set tied at 5-5 and the score at deuce, Djokovic won a pair of rallies to earn the decisive break.Djokovic put extra loft on a forehead to create an unforced error from Nishikori on game point, before triumphantly pointing at his head to illustrate his savvy.He served out to close the match.Nishikori fought hard to stay in the final set but seemed to be bothered by his rackets as he made multiple trips to the side of the court to change.The Japanese player recorded his fourth straight Memphis title in February for his 11th ATP Tour victory, but he cannot seem to solve the worlds top player and has now lost nine straight times to Djokovic.It was a shame to lose but this was my first time final here in Toronto, Nishikori told the Canadian crowd. So, it was a great week.Djokovic, a 12-time grand slam champion, will now turn his focus to the Rio Olympics, a tournament he has yet to conquer.He earned a bronze medal in singles at Beijing in 2008 and fell just short of a medal at London in 2012.I dont need to explain that every athlete dreams of being a part of the Olympic Games, he said.

"Kingston: Lokesh Rahuls Test-best 158 anchored Indias formidable reply to the West Indies first innings total of 196 as the hosts reached 358 for five at stumps on the second day of the second Test at Sabina Park in Jamaica on Sunday.Leading 1-0 in the four-match series, the tourists enjoy a lead of 162 runs with five wickets in hand.Making the most of a recall to the team as replacement for the injured Murali Vijay, Rahul interspersed moments of rare aggression with long periods of watchful defiance over his near seven-hour occupation of the crease in compiling his third hundred in just six Tests.Resuming on the second morning on 75 in partnership with Cheteshwar Pujara, the opening batsman hoisted part-time off spinner Roston Chase for the first six of the innings over long-on to reach three figures after 90 minutes play.There were two more sixes in the mid-afternoon session to embellish an innings that spanned 303 deliveries and also included 15 fours.He put on 121 for the second wicket with Pujara, who was run out for 46 after lunch by Chases direct throw to the stumps at the non-strikers end.That was the only success for a limited West Indies attack through the first two sessions of the day as they struggled to offer any consistent threat to batsmen well equipped technically and temperamentally for the requirements of the day, especially after India had taken such a firm grip on the match by the end of day one.Virat Kohli, in top form following a career-best 200 in the first Test triumph in Antigua a week earlier, seemed in the mood to deepen the home sides dilemma.He helped Rahul add 69 runs for the third wicket going into the final session of the day when the openers innings ended in somewhat controversial circumstances as lengthy deliberation involving the television umpire was needed before he was ruled caught by wicketkeeper Shane Dowrich down the leg-side off fast bowler Shannon Gabriel.Chase snared his second wicket, the prized scalp of Kohli, when the Indian captain fell to a sharp catch by Rajendra Chandrika at short-leg for 44 and leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo earned an LBW verdict against Ravichandran Ashwin.At that stage, India had lost three wickets for 50 runs at 327 for five, a veritable collapse in the context of their virtual impregnability through the first six hours of the innings.However, Ajinkya Rahane and wicketkeeper-batsman Wriddhiman Saha remained unbeaten at the close and together with the rest of the Indian batting will be seeking to play the West Indies completely out of the match on the third day.",08-01-2016,Rahul gives India a lead in Jamai,cricket,Kingston,Saha;Shane;Bishoo;Vijay;Rajendra Chandrika;Rahane;Shannon;Wriddhiman Saha;Devendra Bishoo;Murali Vijay;Shannon Gabriel.Chase;Roston Chase;Ajinkya;Dowrich;Rahul;Roston;Wriddhiman;Pujara;Chase;Rajendra;Ajinkya Rahane;Chandrika;Kohli;Gabriel.Chase;Devendra;Shane Dowrich;Murali,Rahul;Jamai,
"KINGSTON, Jamaica: West Indies vulnerable top-order crumbled again in between the showers to be 48 for four in their second innings at lunch on the rain-affected fourth day of the second Test against India at Sabina Park in Jamaica on Tuesday.Trailing on first innings by 304 runs after the tourists reached 500 for nine declared at tea on the third day, the hosts go into the afternoon session still facing a deficit of 256 runs to avoid a second consecutive innings defeat in the four-match series.Frustrated by a weather system that erased the final session on day three and delayed the start of play on the fourth morning for over an hour, Indias varied attack made up for the lost time by again exploiting the glaring weaknesses of the West Indies batsmen.With his place in the team on the line after a succession of low scores in his fledgling Test career, Rajendra Chandrika was the first to go, bowled for one by a delivery that made extra height from tall fast bowler Ishant Sharma and rebounded off the batsmans right elbow onto the stumps as he attempted to pull out of the shot.His opening partner, Kraigg Brathwaite, and new batsman Darren Bravo were peppered with regular short-pitched bowling from both Sharma and Mohammed Shami.Bravo in particular was lucky to survive the concerted assault but at the other end, the introduction of Amit Mishra broke the 36-run stand when Brathwaite, on 23, miscued an attempted pull off the leg-spinner for Lokesh Rahul to take the catch running back from midwicket.Marlon Samuels was comprehensively bowled by Shami with no addition to the total and off what proved to be the last delivery before the interval, Bravo failed to negotiate another lifting delivery angled into the body and Rahul held the catch at third slip to remove the left-hander for 20.In losing three wickets for seven runs at the end of the truncated session, in which only 15.5 overs were bowled, the West Indies exactly replicated their predicament at the start of the match when their captain, Jason Holder, won the toss and chose to bat first.Roston Chase, who claimed five wickets with his off-spinners in Indias marathon innings, was expected to join Jermaine Blackwood at the crease in the afternoon session with the home side in desperate need of some meaningful resistance, and more realistically significant intervention from the weather, to avoid another innings defeat inside four days.",08-02-2016,Windies top order collapses as India hunt victory,cricket,KINGSTON,Rajendra Chandrika;Brathwaite;Darren;Amit Mishra;Ishant Sharma;Mohammed Shami.Bravo;Lokesh Rahul;Jermaine;Jason;Ishant;Kraigg;Jermaine Blackwood;Rahul;Mishra;Kraigg Brathwaite;Holder;Blackwood;Amit;Mohammed;Shami.Bravo;Shami;Darren Bravo;Lokesh;Rajendra;Jason Holder;Indias;Sharma;Chandrika;Samuels;Bravo,,

"BIRMINGHAM: Pakistan will look to bounce back from a crushing defeat in Manchester when it faces England in the third Test at Edgbaston in Birmingham from Wednesday.Pakistan began the four-match series with an impressive 75-run win in the first Test at Lords but England hit back to level things up with a 330-run win in the second Test at Old Trafford.The first Test saw an inspiring century from captain Misbah-ul-Haq but Pakistans performance in the next game betrayed its batting woes.The concerns start right at the top, with Shan Masood and Mohammad Hafeez struggling in English conditions. Masood in particular has had a tough time against James Anderson, falling to the pacer six times in 57 balls since the two teams met in the United Arab Emirates last year.Naturally, Mickey Arthur, the Pakistan coach, called for a better effort from his top-order batsmen but was tight-lipped about possible changes to the side.<br/> <br/> ""I was really disappointed with our performance at Old Trafford -- really disappointed,"" said Arthur. ""There are credible losses, and there are losses when you lie down and are steamrollered ... Old Trafford was clearly that. I told the guys I thought we were warriors at Lords. We were completely the opposite at Old Trafford.<br/> <br/> ""Weve had discussions (on team changes). Weve given that position some serious thought. Were very clear on what were going to do this Test, but its not for public consumption. It has been a worry.""However, its not just Pakistan whose batting appears vulnerable. England too has a shaky batting line-up dependent heavily on Alastair Cook and Joe Root, who both made hundreds at Old Trafford.James Vince and Gary Ballance are both under pressure to cement their respective places while Alex Hales has managed just 56 runs from four innings in the series. <br/> <br/> The home side will also be without the services of Ben Stokes, who was ruled out with a calf injury suffered at Old Trafford. His absence means England could play two spinners with Adil Rashid, the leg-spinner, waiting in the wings for a home debut in support of off-spinner Moeen Ali.England, though, will be encouraged by the superb form of Chris Woakes, who has taken 26 wickets and scored 221 runs in four Tests this season.""I was thinking I can do it at first-class level, why am I not showing it at the next level?"" said Woakes.

"LONDON: Pakistan have adjusted their plans for Alastair Cook and Joe Root ahead of Wednesday's third test at Edgbaston, the touring side's coach Mickey Arthur has said, adding he considers the duo as the backbone of England's batting.Root scored 254 and an unbeaten 71 while Cook made 105 and 76 not out as Pakistan were beaten by 330 runs on the fourth day of the second test at Old Trafford last week to level the four-match series at 1-1.""We had a look at Cook and Root again,"" Arthur told British media.

"India built a first-innings lead of 304 runs before declaring at 500 for nine on day three of the second test against West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica on Monday.Ajinkya Rahane scored his seventh test century, and the third in four innings, compiling an unbeaten 108 off 237 balls.He made 127 and 100 not out against South Africa in Delhi in December. Rahane brought up his century with a somewhat lucky boundary when he edged off-spinner Roston Chase between the wicketkeeper and first slip.Light rain prompted a brief stoppage during the second session and more showers are forecast for Tuesday at Sabina Park, which might offer West Indies a lifeline as they try to avoid losing the first two tests in the four-match series.But with seven sessions still to play, they face a tall order to save the game. The West Indies bowlers stuck to their task well, keeping the India batsmen subdued for long periods.It took the visitors 171 overs to compile their mammoth total as they scored at less than three runs per over.Chase (5-121) returned the best figures while captain Jason Holder got little reward for his efforts, conceding only 72 runs from 34.2 lively overs.He picked up only one wicket, his first of the series, when he trapped Wriddhiman Saha lbw for 47.",08-02-2016,India declare with 304 run lead over West Indi,cricket,,Saha;Roston;Monday.Ajinkya;Wriddhiman;Holder;Rahane;Wriddhiman Saha;Chase;Jason Holder;Roston Chase;Jason;Monday.Ajinkya Rahane,,

"BIRMINGHAM: Sohail Khan marked his return to Test cricket after a five-year absence with a maiden five-wicket haul as Pakistan dismissed England for 297 on the first day of the third Test at Edgbaston.After Sohail sparked a top-order collapse, England were indebted to left-handers Gary Ballance (70) and Moeen Ali (63) for taking them to what could yet prove a challenging total.Sohail, a 32-year-old right-arm quick, removed a quartet of top-order batsman on his way to figures of five for 96 in 23 overs.Sohails return was all the more impressive as his previous two Tests -- against Sri Lanka at Karachi in 2009 and against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo in 2011 -- had yielded a combined haul of one for 245.A stress fracture of the back after last years World Cup provided a further check on his progress.Nevertheless, Sohail was recalled in place of Wahab Riaz as Pakistan broke up the all left-arm pace attack they had deployed for the first two Tests of this four-match contest following Englands 330-run series-levelling win at Old Trafford.Sohail took the new ball after Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq won the toss on a gloomy morning, with some moisture in the pitch after overnight rain.Alex Hales fell for an unconvincing 17 when caught behind off a good-length Sohail ball.Joe Root had made a Test-best 254 at Old Trafford in a match where he and century-maker Alastair Cook, the England captain, scored 506 runs between them for just twice out.Misbah had described the pair as the ""pillars"" of Englands otherwise fragile top order. Pakistan knocked down the first of those pillars when Root, playing one of his favourite back-foot forcing shots, edged Sohail and was held by sometimes fallible slip fielder Mohammad Hafeez for just three.Left-handed opener Cook, carrying on from where he left off in Manchester, made 45 in 52 balls, including eight fours before Rahat Ali had him lbw.James Vince guided England to 100 for three at lunch. But on 39, an uncertain defensive prod outside off stump against Sohail saw Vince, yet to mae a fifty in his eight Test innings, edge low to second slip Younis Khan.Jonny Bairstow had rescued England from many a dire position in recent times.<br/> But he made just 12 before, trying to cut a sharply bouncing Sohail delivery, he was caught behind by opposing wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed.Ballance, increasingly assured after a shaky start, hit 11 fours. But his 150-ball innings ended when a glance off leg-spinner Yasir Shah was well held by Ahmed, who made good ground to hold the tough chance in an example of Pakistans much-improved catching. Ballances exit ended a sixth-wicket stand of 66 with Ali.Chris Woakes, on his Warwickshire home ground, was then caught behind for nine off an excellent Rahat inswinger.Mohammad Amir, who appeared to be nursing a calf problem, then struck twice with the new ball, including removing Ali when the batsmans loose drive saw Ahmed hold his fifth catch of the innings.Sohail, appropriately, ended the days play when had No 11 James Anderson lbw for five.

"Manny Pacquiao will take on American World Boxing Organisation welterweight champion Jessie Vargas when he returns to the ring on November 5, according to the Filipino boxer's manager Michael Koncz.""Retirement doesn't suit Manny right now,"" Koncz told the Los Angeles Times of the former eight-division world champion.""Boxing is in his blood. When he trains, it's like a pressure-release valve. You can see a dramatic difference in his mood... he's happy. It's amazing what training and fighting does for him.""Pacquiao (58-6-2) had announced his retirement after defeating Timothy Bradley in April and was elected to the Philippines' senate in May. His promoter Bob Arum announced last month that he would fight again in November.Arum tweeted earlier this week that he would travel to the Philippines for a meeting on August 10 to discuss the 37-year-old southpaw's return.Koncz, who will also attend the meeting, said the trio were not discussing a potential opponent, but whether to stage the bout in Los Angeles or Dubai.""That's the essence of the meeting,"" Koncz added. ""Not choosing the opponent. That's already been done.""Pacquiao's unanimous decision win over Bradley was his first fight in nearly a year after his tame loss to Floyd Mayweather. He had said he was bringing the curtain down on his career to concentrate on politics and his family.The 27-year-old Vargas (27-1) beat fellow American Sadam Ali in March to claim the WBO welterweight crown and has won 10 of his bouts via a knockout or stoppage, with his only defeat coming via a points loss to Bradley in June 2015.",08-04-2016,Pacquiao to make ring return against Vargas repor,boxing,,Timothy;Bradley;Sadam Ali;Manny Pacquiao;Mayweather;Bob;Michael;Floyd;Jessie;Sadam;Timothy Bradley;Michael Koncz;Bob Arum;Manny;Koncz;Arum;Jessie Vargas;Pacquiao;Floyd Mayweather;Vargas;Ali,Pacquiao;Manny Pacquiao,American World Boxing Organisation;WBO;Los Angeles Times

"RIO DE JANEIRO: The statue of Christ the Redeemer overlooking Rio de Janeiro was illuminated in Brazil's yellow and green national colors on Thursday as the city put the finishing touches to its preparations for South America's first Olympics.Workers rushed to install wiring and put up signs at venues as the Olympic flame made its way through the city of 6 million carried by a succession of sportsmen, stars and even a Nobel laureate, to cheers from thousands of residents who succumbed to the excitement of the Games.It was a far cry from the previous evening, when riot police had used stun grenades and tear gas to clear protesters from the torch's path in a poor suburb of Rio, fuelling complaints that the Games have ignored the city's poor.Those anti-torch demonstrations - the second in two days - underscored simmering social tensions in Latin America's largest nation amid its worst economic downturn since the Great Depression and a political crisis that has deeply divided the country.That resentment was nowhere to be seen on Thursday as the torch progressed through the well-heeled districts of Barra de Tijuca, where the Games will be held.""It's impossible to explain the emotion of carrying the torch,"" said Brazil's double World Cup winning soccer captain Cafu, who joined Nobel peace prize winner Muhammad Yunus in carrying the Olympic flame on its penultimate day.Brazil will open its Games on Friday in the famed Maracana soccer stadium with a ceremony showcasing samba and the drumming made famous by Rio's Carnival celebrations - which will be watched by 50,000 in the arena and an estimated 3 billion around the world by television.The torch rode the waves into Rio on Thursday in the hands of veteran Brazilian surfer Rico de Souza, a day after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced surfing - a major pastime in Brazil - would be one of five new sports included in the 2020 Olympics.""It was incredible for us. We've been waiting for a long time for the Olympics and for surfing to be part of the Games,"" said local surfer Milton Roberto, among hundreds of fans who cheered Souza as he did laps of Macumba beach after carrying the torch out of the ocean.Some 500,000 foreign visitors are descending on the iconic beach city. They are protected by 85,000 police and soldiers, more than double the number of security personnel in the 2012 Games in London.The brief abduction of three Swedish tourists by armed men on Wednesday after they stopped to take photos near a dangerous slum highlighted the security challenges facing organizers. The three were released unharmed, authorities said.The opposition has called a demonstration against interim President Michel Temer's government for Friday outside the Maracana stadium, accusing him of conducting a 'coup' against suspended leftist President Dilma Rousseff, who is being placed on trial in the Senate.The tense political atmosphere may have deterred some foreign leaders from attending the Games, with Brazilian presidency sources saying only 28 heads of state have confirmed their presence - around half what was expected last week.French President Francois Hollande, whose country is bidding for the 2024 Games, toured Rio de Janeiro's Olympic Park on Thursday, met with members of his national swim team and posed for photos in front of the Olympic rings.The volatile political situation has added to concerns over crime, water pollution, late infrastructure and an outbreak of the Zika virus in northern Brazil earlier this year that clouded the build-up to the Games.The mayor's office declared holidays on Thursday and Friday to ease persistent problems with traffic.The Olympic soccer competition entered a second day on Thursday with Brazil eking out a disappointing 0-0 draw against South Africa in the national stadium in the capital Brasilia. Soccer is the only sport with games taking place outside the host city.Fans of the national team watched the game in the rehabilitated Praa Mau square by Rio's port, home to a new museum and water-front promenade built for the Games.

But the pairs Yorkshire colleague Bairstow, in at 257 for four, scored briskly and he received excellent support from Ali as they overpowered a tiring Pakistan attack featuring just four frontline bowlers.England scored 152 runs in Saturdays final session, after managing 142 runs in the first two sessions combined.Play resumed Saturday with England captain Cook 64 not out and Hales 50 not out after they had erased a first-innings deficit of 103 with their maiden century stand in 18 innings as a Test-match opening pair. But Pakistan soon removed both batsmen.Left-hander Cook (66) pushed out to first-innings five-wicket hero Sohail Khan and a diving Shah held an excellent catch at point.Mohammad Amir then turned 126 for one into 126 for two when Hales (54) edged a seaming delivery from the left-arm quick and Younis Khan held a difficult low chance at second slip.Root, who made a Test-best 254 in Englands 330-run series-levelling win at Old Trafford, struck two superb fours off Sohail -- a back-foot force followed by a cover-drive.Root, however, had a reprieve on 25 when he edged Rahat Ali only for Mohammad Hafeez to drop the low, two-handed, chance at first slip.It was tough on left-arm paceman Rahat, who bowled superbly in reeling off five straight maidens in a spell of seven overs for just seven runs.After lunch, Root pulled Shah for a boundary that saw him to a 108-ball fifty.<br/> But Shah, bowling into the rough outside leg stump, had his revenge when Root, not for the first time this season, mistimed a sweep and gave a simple catch to Hafeez at short fine leg.Vince, yet to make a fifty in nine Test innings, had been composed in equalling his highest score at this level of 42. But he too fell in familiar fashion when, flirting outside off stump against the new ball, he wastefully guided Amir to second slip Younis.England, 262 for four at tea, lost Ballance (28) on 285 when Shah, bowling round the wicket, had the left-hander well caught by leg slip Asad Shafiq off a genuine glance. But Ali cover-drove Shah for four and, two balls later, he whipped him for another four wide of mid-on.Bairstow clipped Sohail off his pads and swept Shah for two well-struck fours on his way to a 69-ball fifty.

"BULAWAYO: Opener Tom Latham scored his second consecutive century in Zimbabwe as New Zealands batsmen dominated the opening day of the second Test at Queens Sports Club on Saturday.Lathams 105 set New Zealand up for a mammoth total and crushing victory in the first Test, and he bettered that score to give the Black Caps a commanding platform.The 24-year-old recorded his fifth Test century and went on to make 136, before succumbing to what proved to be the final ball of the day as New Zealand closed on 329 for two.Zimbabwes bowlers claimed just six wickets in a horribly one-sided first Test, and endured a similarly frustrating day on another docile pitch on Saturday.With the seamers lacking in pace, Latham and Martin Guptill had no trouble seeing off the new ball and went on to construct an opening stand of 169.Guptill was eventually dismissed in the hour before tea when Donald Tiripano snuck a straight delivery through his defences to trap him lbw for 87.But any joy for Zimbabwe was short-lived, as Latham went on to add 160 for the second wicket with Kane Williamson.Latham failed to see out the day when he was caught and bowled by left-arm spinner Sean Williams, but Williamson went to stumps unbeaten on 95, within touching distance of becoming the first New Zealand batsman to score a century against all nine Test nations.The day also saw Zimbabwes fans stage a peaceful protest against President Robert Mugabes government when they rose as one at the end of the 36th over to sing the national anthem.The number signified the number of years that Mugabe has been in power, and the action was initiated by the #ThisFlag citizen movement that has brought stayaways and public demonstrations across the country over the past six weeks.<br/> Their call to action drew the biggest crowd that Queens had seen during the series.",08-06-2016,Latham ton helps Black Caps dominate Zimbab,cricket,BULAWAYO,Robert Mugabes;Mugabe;Kane Williamson.Latham;Latham;Tom Latham;Sean Williams;Martin;Tiripano;Kane;Donald;Williamson.Latham;Mugabes;Williamson;Tom;Williams;Martin Guptill;Guptill;Robert;Donald Tiripano;Sean,Latham;Zimbab;Tom Latham,Queens Sports Club

"BULAWAYO: Hundreds of protestors waved Zimbabwes national flag and sang the national anthem during a cricket match against New Zealand on Saturday, in a sign of mounting opposition to President Robert Mugabe.Circumventing laws which forbid political gatherings without police clearance, protestors at the ground in Bulawayo, the countrys second largest city, rose at the 36th over and began singing the national anthem while waving the national flag,which has been turned into a symbol of protest.""I am in complete support of the protest because of the situation in the country,"" activist Mandla Dungeni told AFP.""We need to get the message across that its time up, using whatever means available to us.

The demonstration was dispersed by mounted police.After 36 years of Mugabes authoritarian rule, Zimbabwe has seen a rise in opposition protests fuelled by internet activism using the hashtag ""ThisFlag"" - a reference to wearing the national flag in public.On Wednesday hundreds of protestors held a march in the capital calling on 92-year-old Mugabe to step down over worsening economic troubles which have seen banks running short of cash and the government failing to pay its workers on time.Three weeks ago, Zimbabwes independence war veterans, who had been loyal allies of Mugabe, issued a strongly-worded statement calling on him to step down.Despite his advanced age, the president has fought back, vowing to crack down on leaders of the protests.The ruling party on Thursday expelled four war veterans suspected to be behind the criticism.",08-06-2016,Zimbabweans against government and cricket match against New Zealand,cricket,BULAWAYO,Mandla;Evan Mawarire;Mugabe;Robert;Mandla Dungeni;Rose;Dungeni;Mawarire;Evan,,AFP;Women of Zimbabwe Arise

"GALLE: Off-spinner Dilruwan Perera bagged six wickets to fashion Sri Lankas historic series win over Australia Saturday as the world number one side suffered a humiliating 229-run loss inside three days in the second Test in Galle.Australia, chasing a challenging 413 for victory, were bundled out for 183 after lunch as Sri Lanka, who won their last series against the visitors in 1999, took an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match rubber.Veteran spinner Rangana Herath set up the win for the hosts with his maiden Test hat-trick which helped dismiss Australia for a record low of 106 in their first innings.Australia faltered in their second outing as well after Perera, who registered his career-best figures of 6-70, sent the visitors packing in just 50.1 overs as the Sri Lankan players went into a celebratory huddle.Overnight batsmen David Warner and skipper Steven Smith offered some resistance with their 51-run fourth wicket partnership but both of them fell to Pereras guile.Warner, who tried to counter attack during his 31-ball 41, was trapped lbw off a straighter Perera delivery that hit the batsman on the front pad.Smith (30), who used his feet well against the spinners during his 58-ball stay, was the next to go as he gave away a catch at backward short leg.Perera, who also took two wickets on Friday, then bowled Adam Voges for 28 to register his fourth five-wicket haul in 11 Test matches.But it was Heraths left-arm spin that did the early damage in a match dominated by Sri Lankan slow bowlers.Herath and Perera shared four wickets between them on a chaotic second day which saw the fall of 21 wickets and put the match on the fast track.Australias pace spearhead Mitchell Starc though made his presence felt on a track that offered little help to the fast bowlers with his career-best match figures of 11-94.Sri Lanka won the first Test at Pallekele by 106 runs.",08-06-2016,Sri Lanka beat Australia 229 runs clinch seri,cricket,GALLE,Herath;Mitchell Starc;Smith;Rangana Herath;Adam Voges;Rangana;Steven;Adam;Warner;Voges;Mitchell;Starc;Dilruwan Perera;David;Steven Smith;Dilruwan;David Warner;Perera,,
"Birmingham: Mickey Arthur said Friday that winning series away from their adopted UAE home would be Pakistans acid test after former side Australias struggles in Sri Lanka bolstered their hopes of becoming the worlds number one Test team.Pakistan are currently third in the International Cricket Council standings, with Australia on top.But they could rise to the summit if Australia lose their ongoing series in Sri Lanka and Pakistan themselves triumph in England.The first part of that equation moved nearer to reality Friday when Australia, already 1-0 down in a three-match campaign, were left staring at defeat on an extraordinary second day of the second Test in Galle at 25 for three chasing a mammoth 413 for victory.Pakistan, all square at 1-1 in a four-match series with England, had a better, if frustrating, time on Fridays third day of the third Test at Edgbaston.Having established a first-innings lead of 103, they saw England captain Alastair Cook (64 not out) and Alex Hales (50 not out) erase the deficit with an unbroken opening stand of 120 that left the hosts 17 runs in front at stumps.For Pakistan coach Arthur, dramatically sacked by Australia on the eve of the 2013 Ashes series in England, events in Galle had not gone unnoticed.""Misbah (Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq) and I did chat about it on the bus as we saw the Australian score from Sri Lanka,"" Arthur told reporters after stumps at Edgbaston.""I think the reality is if you want to be number one in the world youve got to be able to win away from home.""Weve got a tough schedule -- England here, then New Zealand away in two Tests in November and then we go and play in Australia, Boxing Day (Melbourne), the New Year (Sydney) and the night Test in Brisbane.""But for us to be where we want to be, those are the series weve got to win.""/><strong>Sohail concern</strong> Arthur, who made his international reputation as coach of his native South Africa, lamented a lack of support for left-arm quick Mohammad Amir and leg-spinner Yasir Shah on Friday.Sohail Khan, who Arthur said was prone to inaccuracy along with fellow seamer Rahat Ali because their front arm fell away or was ""lost"" in delivery, marked his first Test in five years with an impressive five for 96 in Englands first innings 297 at Edgbaston.But he tired markedly in a return of none for 40 in eight overs on Friday.<br/>""It is a real concern,"" said Arthur.""Hes got to back up. I thought he bowled exceptionally well in the first innings but the key is youve got to do it both innings.""The coach added: ""Mohammad Amir bowled outstandingly well tonight (Friday).

We just need a little bit of support for those two.""Pakistans top-order have struggled in England.But Thursday saw a second-wicket stand of 181 between Azhar Ali, whose 139 was his first Test century outside of Asia, and Sami Aslam (82).Left-handed opener Aslams highest Test score was particularly impressive as it came in the 20-year-olds first innings of this series and just his third match at this level.""That was real Test batting from Sami and Azhar,"" said Arthur.<br/>""The lessons weve learnt from the tour, they were all put into place.

"LONDON: Last year Syrian refugee Yusra Mardini had to swim for her life when her boat broke down as she tried to reach Europe; this month the teenager will be swimming in the Rio Olympics.Yusra, who is a member of the first ever Olympic refugee team, told how she and her sister Sara feared they might drown after their overloaded dinghy started taking in water as they crossed the Mediterranean to Greece.Along with another refugee they jumped in the sea and pulled the boat for three hours through the water, saving the lives of 19 others.""When I was in the water there was fear. You don't know whether you are going to live or die,"" the 18-year-old said in a video interview published by the International Organization for Migration (IOM).Mardini, who will compete in the 100-metre freestyle, is among 10 athletes in the refugee team which will march behind the Olympic flag at Friday's opening ceremony in Brazil.""When I was swimming for my life, I never would have believed I would be where I am now,"" the IOM quoted her as saying.The two sisters, who now live in Germany, left their home in Syria's war-battered capital Damascus a year ago and headed to Turkey.One evening they boarded a dinghy on the Turkish coast along with 20 others - around three times as many people as it was designed to carry.""Before you go on the boat, people tell you that you are going to die,"" Sara told IOM in an interview published on Monday.""So the first thing you think about when you get on that boat is death.

When I first got into the water my whole body was shaking like it does just before competition,"" she said.""At that very moment I felt that life was bigger than me alone.

"RIO DE JANEIRO: The Rio Olympics opening ceremony started with fireworks and laser lit choreography on Friday as Brazil sought to forget seven years of troubled preparations and the Olympic movement to temporarily put aside its doping crisis.Under the gaze of Rios Christ the Redeemer statue, 78,000 packed into the iconic Maracana Stadium to watch four-hour party with Michael Phelps and other sporting superstars taking centre stage in South Americas first Olympics.Brazilian singer Paulinho da Viola sang the national anthem with children to set off the show of laser lights and elaborate dances before the athletes parade.Frances President Francois Hollande and Argentinas Mauricio Macri were among a handful of state leaders in the VIP box with Brazils troubled interim leader Michel Temer.Organisers said the opening ceremony aimed to send a message of tolerance and respect. But it came as Brazil battles a crippling recession, double-digit unemployment and rising crime and Temer fought off political turmoil.As the clock ticked down to the start of the ceremony, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets to vent their fury at Brazils rulers and the multi-billion-dollar cost of the Games.Waving signs reading ""No to the Olympics!"", about 3,000 people gathered outside the luxury Copacabana Palace Hotel where many Olympic athletes are staying.Brazil has spent more than $10 billion on new infrastructure and preparing for the Games at a time of economic crisis.The billions lavished on the Games has angered many Brazilians as the country grapples with a tanking economy and mass social problems.""This party wasnt done for the people. The Games dont come close to the reality lived by the poor. So Im protesting against the lack of finances for our schools and for the way our salaries are only paid in instalments,"" said teacher Guilherme Moreira Dias, 38.The ceremony launches 17 days of sporting drama led by a cast of elite athletes including sprint king Usain Bolt and swimming superstar Phelps which wraps up on August 21.As well as the economic problems, Brazil is also in the grip of a political crisis which led to the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff. She refused to attend the ceremony, leaving Temer in her place with a hostile reception from the crowd predicted.At most Games the lighting of the flame is a highlight.And the secret of the Rio flame returned ahead of the ceremony when Brazilian football great Pele, 75, said he could not carry the torch because of poor health.A vast security blanket of 85,000 military and police -- twice the number on duty at the 2012 London Games -- will be draped over the city to ward off the threat of street crime and terror attacks.That has not been able to offer total protection, with a spate of thefts from the Olympic Athletes village. The Danish, Chinese and Australian delegations have all reported items stolen. Journalists cameras and laptops have also been targeted for thefts.Anticipation for the sporting battles has been eclipsed by fallout from the Russian doping scandal that has divided the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the World Anti-Doping Agency.The IOCs decision not to impose a blanket ban on Russia over revelations of a state-sponsored doping program opened the door to legal turmoil. That left the precise make-up of the Russian team in limbo. On Thursday, the IOC confirmed the Russian team would be made up of 271 athletes, with 118 eliminated because of the drug scandal.The first gold medal should be awarded on Saturday in shooting.All eyes will be on American swimming star Phelps, the most decorated Olympian in history, when he returns to the pool in the first week.Track and field will see Jamaican star Bolt aim to defend his 100m, 200m and 4x100m crowns by clinching all three for the third straight Games.Gymnastics, meanwhile, could see the world find a new darling with Americas teenage star Simone Biles while new sports making their debut in Rio will include seven-a-side rugby and golf.",08-06-2016,Rios glittering opening launches Olympi,olympics,RIO DE JANEIRO,Biles;Mauricio;Hollande;Macri;Dilma Rousseff;Simone;Francois Hollande;Michel;Paulinho da Viola;Dilma;Michael;Argentinas;Guilherme;Viola;Moreira;Rios Christ;Rios;Christ;Simone Biles;Argentinas Mauricio Macri;Temer;Rousseff;Pele;Michael Phelps;Phelps;Paulinho;Francois;Dias;Guilherme Moreira Dias;da;Temer.Organisers;Michel Temer.Organisers,Rios;Rios Christ,International Olympic Committee;IOC
